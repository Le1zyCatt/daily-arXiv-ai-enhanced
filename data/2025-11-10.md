### [1] [Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152)
*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将可变形高斯泼溅分解为前景和背景组件的方法，通过稀疏掩码在稀疏相机配置下实现高质量的动态3D重建，在模型大小减半的情况下PSNR提升高达3分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电影制作中预算限制导致的稀疏相机配置问题，现有方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时存在局限。

Method: 使用t=0帧的稀疏掩码将规范高斯泼溅和变形场分解为前景和背景组件，分别在不同损失函数下进行规范预训练，然后在动态训练中为每个变形场建模不同参数。

Result: 在3D和2.5D娱乐数据集上实现SotA的定性和定量结果，模型大小减半时PSNR提升高达3分，并能生成包括透明和动态纹理的分割动态重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下实现了高质量的动态3D重建，无需密集掩码监督即可生成分割的动态重建结果。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

### [2] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是首个以印度次大陆为中心的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三种任务，共约5K图像和37K+问答对，评估了8个模型并揭示了当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数视觉语言模型评估基准都是西方中心的，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的评估，因此需要建立一个专注于印度次大陆的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了IndicVisionBench基准，覆盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、多模态机器翻译和视觉问答三种任务，涉及13个文化相关主题，共收集约5K图像和37K+问答对，并发布了10种印度语言的并行标注语料库。

Result: 评估了8个模型（包括专有闭源系统和开源模型），发现当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著的性能差距，暴露了其局限性。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench通过关注文化多样性和多语言性，建立了一个可复现的评估框架，为更包容的多模态研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [3] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识的异常检测方法，用于检测合成图像中的网络诱导形状伪影，通过两阶段框架（特征提取器和隔离森林检测器）在乳腺X光合成数据集上实现了高精度的伪影检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在解决机器学习模型训练数据稀缺问题上很有前景，但缺乏质量评估可能导致引入伪影、失真和不真实特征，从而影响模型性能和临床实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）新颖的特征提取器，通过分析解剖边界角度梯度的每图像分布构建专门特征空间；2）基于隔离森林的异常检测器。在两个合成乳腺X光数据集上进行验证。

Result: 方法成功将伪影集中在最异常分区（第1百分位数），AUC值分别为0.97（CSAW-syn）和0.91（VMLO-syn）。读者研究显示人类读者与算法检测结果有66%-68%的一致性，Kendall-Tau相关性为0.45和0.43。

Conclusion: 该方法在负责任使用合成数据方面迈出了重要一步，使开发者能够根据已知解剖约束评估合成图像，定位并解决特定问题，从而提高合成数据集整体质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [4] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Condition Preference Optimization (CPO)方法，通过在控制条件而非生成图像上进行偏好学习，显著提升了文本到图像生成的可控性，优于现有的ControlNet++方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++在优化可控性时存在局限性：只优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入近似误差；而直接偏好优化(DPO)难以确保图像对仅在可控性上存在差异。

Method: 提出条件偏好优化(CPO)，在控制信号而非生成图像上构建偏好对，训练模型偏好获胜控制信号。这种方法消除了混杂因素，提供了低方差训练目标。

Result: CPO在多个控制类型上显著优于ControlNet++：分割任务错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态任务降低70-80%，边缘和深度图任务稳定降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO通过直接在控制条件上进行偏好学习，有效提升了可控性，同时降低了计算和存储需求，在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [5] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DARN（动态自适应正则化网络），一种新颖的解码器架构，通过动态调整正则化策略来应对卫星图像的异质性，在完整微调和高效适应两种范式下都取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准适应方法使用固定正则化策略，无法应对卫星图像的显著异质性，限制了基础模型在地理空间分析中的有效应用。

Method: DARN包含三个关键创新：轻量级任务复杂度预测器（TCP）、自适应dropout调制（ADM）和动态容量门控（DCG），能够根据样本复杂度动态调整正则化强度。

Result: 在完整微调模式下，DARN在GeoBench基准上达到86.66% mIoU（比之前SOTA提升5.56个百分点）；在高效适应模式下，在Sen1Floods11上达到90.5% mIoU，并在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DARN为关键地理空间应用提供了更智能、鲁棒和高效的基础模型利用方法。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练-微调框架的机器学习方法，从全球卫星观测中重建热带气旋的3D云结构，首次实现全球瞬时3D云图生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋预报面临卫星观测有限和云属性解析困难的挑战，现有方法在强风暴区域验证不足。

Method: 采用预训练-微调管道，利用多卫星全球覆盖数据，将2D卫星图像转换为相关云属性的3D云图，并在定制热带气旋数据集上评估。

Result: 首次创建全球瞬时3D云图，准确重建强风暴的3D结构，扩展可用卫星观测并在观测缺失时提供估计。

Conclusion: 该方法对增进热带气旋强化理解和改进预报至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EETnet，一种基于事件的眼动追踪卷积神经网络，能够在资源受限的微控制器上运行，包括分类和回归两种架构版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的眼动追踪方案大多依赖强大GPU，无法在嵌入式设备上部署，需要开发能在资源受限设备上运行的解决方案。

Method: 设计了专门用于事件数据的CNN网络，提出训练、评估和量化方法，包括基于网格的分类模型和像素级回归模型两种架构。

Result: 开发出可在微控制器上运行的EETnet网络，使用公开数据集进行训练和量化。

Conclusion: 成功实现了在资源受限嵌入式设备上运行的基于事件相机的眼动追踪解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [8] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3D高斯点编码器，这是一种基于学习到的3D高斯混合的显式逐点嵌入方法，相比传统的隐式表示（如PointNet）在速度和参数效率上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D识别任务主要使用隐式表示（如PointNet），但显式几何表示在3D重建领域已显示出优势。作者希望将这种从隐式到显式的转变引入3D识别任务，以获得更好的计算效率。

Method: 开发了基于自然梯度和从PointNet蒸馏的优化技术，学习能够重建PointNet激活的高斯基。扩展了3D高斯泼溅的滤波技术来加速编码器。

Result: 3D高斯点编码器比传统PointNet快2.7倍，内存减少46%，FLOPs减少88%。在Mamba3D中运行时快1.27倍，内存和FLOPs分别减少42%和54%。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器提供了一种轻量级的显式几何表示方法，能够在仅CPU设备上实现高帧率，为3D识别任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [9] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了Cellpose等通用生物医学图像分割模型的数据冗余和跨域遗忘问题，提出了数据集量化策略来构建紧凑训练子集，并探索了选择性重放和训练域排序来缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用生物医学图像分割模型在多样化成像模态和细胞类型中应用日益广泛，但训练数据冗余程度和跨域迁移对模型保留的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用数据集量化(DQ)策略构建紧凑训练子集，通过MAE嵌入和t-SNE进行潜在空间分析，进行跨域微调实验评估灾难性遗忘，并测试选择性DQ重放和训练域排序策略。

Result: 在Cyto数据集上，仅使用10%数据即可达到性能饱和；DQ选择比随机采样捕获更多特征多样性；跨域微调导致源域性能显著下降；选择性重放5-10%源数据可有效恢复源性能；训练域排序改善泛化并减少遗忘。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割需要以数据为中心的设计，高效训练不仅需要紧凑子集，还需要保留感知的学习策略和明智的域排序。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [10] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合主动学习和伪标注的数据中心AI工作流，利用基础模型生成伪标签来配置nnU-Net，然后选择代表性样本进行少量人工标注，显著减少标注需求的同时保持竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证的问题，以及基础模型在特定数据集上性能不足的局限性，为生物医学研究者提供更易使用的AI分割解决方案。

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标签用于nnU-Net自配置，然后通过主动学习选择代表性核心集进行少量人工标注，最后微调nnU-Net模型。

Result: 显著减少了人工标注的需求，同时保持了竞争性的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该工作流为生物医学研究者提供了应用最先进AI技术的可访问解决方案，在减少人工干预的同时实现了良好的分割效果。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪效果，通过标签向量集自然地嵌入分割过程，提高去噪的准确性和几何结构的保持能力。

Method: 基于标签向量集的法向量相似性进行分割，结合全变分正则化，采用分裂Bregman（ADMM）方法求解优化问题，顶点更新步骤基于二阶形状微积分。

Result: 该方法能够有效地进行几何去噪，同时保持几何结构，通过法向量先验知识和分割过程提高了去噪质量。

Conclusion: 提出的基于法向量先验知识的几何去噪框架结合分割和正则化，为几何处理提供了一种有效的新方法，分裂Bregman方法确保了优化问题的有效求解。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不规则点云恢复高质量表面是病态问题，需要强几何先验。传统方法依赖外部训练数据，本文旨在直接从输入点云本身提取形状特定先验。

Method: 联合训练可学习嵌入字典与隐式距离场，通过交叉注意力捕获形状结构；使用自监督点云重建损失优化；结合RIMLS集成稠密点云和法向量。

Result: 方法在生成高保真表面方面优于经典和基于学习的方法，具有更好的细节保持和对数据退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 隐式自先验方法能够有效从点云中学习形状特定先验，结合RIMLS实现高质量表面重建，无需外部训练数据。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

TL;DR: 提出了Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据在多站点采集时的扫描仪特异性偏差问题，相比传统ComBAT方法更适合临床场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DW-MRI数据在多站点采集时存在扫描仪特异性偏差，传统ComBAT方法依赖线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量等假设，限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Method: Clinical-ComBAT独立地对每个站点进行数据协调，采用非线性多项式数据模型，以规范站点为参考进行站点特定协调，并包含适用于小队列的方差先验、超参数调整和拟合优度度量。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT克服了传统方法的限制，为临床环境中的多站点DW-MRI数据协调提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉变换器模型（特别是Swin变换器）在提高耳科疾病诊断准确性方面的效果，发现初始结果虽好但存在数据泄露问题，修正后性能显著下降，强调了医学机器学习中数据处理的严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于耳鼻喉科专科医生有27%的误诊率，提高耳科疾病诊断准确性至关重要，本研究旨在探索视觉变换器模型相比传统卷积神经网络在诊断准确性方面的优势。

Method: 使用智利大学临床医院耳鼻喉科的真实世界耳镜检查视频数据集，基于拉普拉斯和香农熵阈值选择帧并移除空白帧，比较Swin v1、Swin v2变换器模型与ResNet模型的性能。

Result: 初始结果显示Swin v1和Swin v2分别达到100%和99.1%的准确率，略优于ResNet（99.5%），但发现数据泄露问题。修正后准确率降至：Swin v1和Swin v2均为83%，ResNet为82%。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器模型虽有潜力，但必须在先进模型架构与有效数据预处理之间找到最佳平衡，这对开发可靠的耳科疾病诊断机器学习模型至关重要。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卫星图像的地理空间深度学习框架，用于预测致命交通事故风险，能够生成完整的Beta概率分布而非单一确定性输出，在召回率上比基线方法提升17-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通安全研究孤立分析风险因素，忽视空间复杂性；传统神经网络风险估计器缺乏不确定性表达，限制了在关键决策中的应用。

Method: 利用卫星图像作为综合空间输入，通过地理空间深度学习框架捕捉细微空间模式和嵌入式环境风险因素，估计致命事故风险的完整Beta概率分布。

Result: 模型在召回率指标上比基线方法提升17-23%，提供更优的校准性能，能够仅从卫星图像提供可靠且可解释的风险评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供更安全的导航支持，并为城市规划者和政策制定者提供高度可扩展的工具，以公平且经济高效地提升道路安全。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多退化图像恢复网络IMDNet，通过解耦退化成分表示来指导路径选择，能够同时处理多种共存的图像退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像往往同时存在多种退化（如雨、噪声、雾霾），而现有方法大多只关注单一退化类型，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 设计了退化成分解耦块(DIDBlock)在编码器中分离退化成分，融合块(FBlock)整合多层级退化信息，任务适应块(TABlock)在解码器中动态激活功能分支选择最优恢复路径。

Result: 实验验证表明IMDNet在多退化恢复任务上表现优异，同时在单一退化任务上保持强大竞争力。

Conclusion: IMDNet通过紧密集成的架构有效解决了多退化图像恢复问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: 该数据集是推进AI驱动口腔医疗解决方案的重要资源，已公开发布供未来研究使用。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习的新型深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，在深度伪造检测中实现更好的鲁棒性和脆弱性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致深度伪造日益逼真，现有被动检测器依赖特定伪造伪影难以泛化，主动水印方法在鲁棒性和敏感性之间难以平衡。

Method: 使用可学习的水印嵌入器在高维潜在空间操作，结合多智能体对抗强化学习范式，通过良性恶意图像操作动态课程训练实现鲁棒性和脆弱性的最优平衡。

Result: 在CelebA和CelebA-HQ基准测试中持续优于最先进方法，在挑战性操作场景下分别提升4.5%和5.3%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法通过潜在空间表示和MAARL范式成功解决了深度伪造检测中水印方法的鲁棒性-脆弱性平衡问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

TL;DR: CLM系统通过CPU内存卸载策略，使3D高斯泼溅技术能够在单个消费级GPU上渲染大型场景，解决了内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然渲染速度快、质量高，但在大型场景中内存需求过大，超过大多数GPU的容量限制。

Method: 采用CPU内存卸载策略，仅在需要时将高斯数据加载到GPU内存；利用3DGS内存访问模式进行流水线处理，重叠GPU-CPU通信、GPU计算和CPU计算；通过访问模式分析减少通信量。

Result: 在单个RTX4090上成功渲染需要1亿个高斯的大型场景，并达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统有效解决了3DGS在大场景中的内存瓶颈问题，使其能够在消费级硬件上高效运行。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 提出PDS方法解决fMRI和dMRI模态缺失问题，通过模式感知双模态3D扩散框架和组织细化网络，在OASIS-3、ADNI等数据集上取得最先进结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI和dMRI在神经退行性疾病研究中至关重要，但模态缺失限制了其临床应用。现有GAN和扩散模型方法在fMRI-dMRI合成中存在BOLD信号与扩散加权信号差异大、疾病相关神经解剖模式整合不足的问题

Method: 提出PDS方法：1）模式感知双模态3D扩散框架进行跨模态学习；2）集成高效微结构细化的组织细化网络，保持结构保真度和细节

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI和内部数据集上，fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM达29.83 dB/90.84%（比基线提升+1.54 dB/+4.12%），dMRI合成达30.00 dB/77.55%（提升+1.02 dB/+2.2%）。临床验证中合成数据在NC vs MCI vs AD分类中准确率达67.92%/66.02%/64.15%

Conclusion: PDS方法有效解决了fMRI-dMRI模态合成中的挑战，在定量指标和临床诊断性能上均优于现有方法，为神经退行性疾病的临床研究提供了可靠工具

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个端到端的可微分框架，通过傅里叶级数参数化任意形状，使用基于环绕数的映射将形状转换为DNN所需的像素网格，并利用信号能量约束增强优化效率，探索深度神经网络对几何形状的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络研究主要关注纹理特征，而对几何形状的理解能力缺乏系统探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究形状如何作为语义载体、解释工具和对抗攻击手段。

Method: 开发了一个端到端的可微分框架，包含：1）使用傅里叶级数参数化任意形状；2）基于环绕数的映射方法将形状转换为像素网格；3）信号能量约束确保物理上合理的形状并提高优化效率。

Result: 研究表明：1）优化后的形状可以作为有效的语义载体，仅凭几何特征就能产生高置信度的分类；2）形状是精确隔离模型显著区域的高保真解释工具；3）构成了一种新的、可泛化的对抗范式，能够欺骗下游视觉任务。

Conclusion: 该工作为探索深度神经网络的几何世界提供了一个多功能框架，并为挑战和理解机器感知开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了用于训练和评估拓扑数据分析模型和技术的标记3D数据集的空白。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别出现有LVLM架构存在固有的语言模态偏差，主要源于将视觉嵌入简单附加到输入文本序列的常见做法，这影响了模型的视觉定位能力并导致幻觉问题。

Method: 通过整合平均池化的视觉特征来优化文本嵌入，这是一种简单但有效的方法，能够改进视觉信息与文本的融合。

Result: 该方法在已建立的基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位能力，并显著减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化提供了一种简单、稳健且高效的视觉信息整合方式，但更复杂的融合方法可能进一步增强视觉定位和跨模态对齐，这留待未来工作探索。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

TL;DR: 提出DRE-SLCL方法，通过动态残差编码和切片级对比学习实现全切片图像(WSI)的端到端表示学习，解决了GPU内存限制下无法同时处理所有图像块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像(WSI)表示对于癌症分型、识别和突变预测至关重要，但由于单个切片包含数万个图像块，在当前GPU限制下难以在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储所有WSI中图像块的特征，训练时随机采样部分块计算特征，同时从内存库中选择同一WSI的额外特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和检索特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI的表示和组织病理学报告计算切片级对比损失。

Result: 在癌症分型、癌症识别和突变预测任务上的实验证明了所提DRE-SLCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法能够有效解决WSI端到端表示学习中的计算挑战，在多个癌症相关任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运动捕捉需要专门设备的问题，提供一种隐私保护、低成本和低光照条件下可行的替代方案。由于压力信号与全身运动之间存在不确定性的严重不适定问题，需要引入额外约束。

Method: 提出Pressure2Motion生成模型，使用压力特征作为输入，文本提示作为高级引导约束。采用双级特征提取器准确解释压力数据，结合分层扩散模型识别大尺度运动轨迹和细微姿势调整。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成高保真、物理合理的运动，为该任务建立了新的最先进水平。建立了首个该任务的MPL基准测试。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是利用压力数据和语言先验进行运动生成的先驱工作，为隐私保护运动捕捉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NTP-MRISeg框架，将医学参考图像分割重新定义为基于多模态序列的自回归下一个标记预测任务，简化了模型设计并实现了端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学参考图像分割方法通常涉及复杂的多模态融合或多阶段解码器设计，需要更简化的解决方案。

Method: 将MRIS重新定义为自回归下一个标记预测任务，使用统一的多模态序列（图像、文本和掩码标记），并提出Next-k Token Prediction、Token-level Contrastive Learning和Hard Error Token优化策略。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的实验表明，NTP-MRISeg达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg为传统MRIS流程提供了一个简化且有效的替代方案，通过统一的架构和预训练标记器增强了泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PITTA的新型单目深度估计测试时自适应框架，通过姿态无关的TTA范式和实例感知图像掩码策略，在无需相机姿态信息的情况下有效提升模型在动态环境中的深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目深度估计测试时自适应方法在多样化动态环境中效果不佳，需要解决模型部署环境与训练环境不一致的问题。

Method: 采用姿态无关的TTA范式，结合实例感知图像掩码策略，利用预训练的全景分割网络提取动态对象掩码，并提出了有效的边缘提取方法。

Result: 在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，PITTA框架显著超越了现有最先进技术，在测试时自适应过程中取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PITTA框架通过创新的姿态无关自适应和实例感知掩码策略，成功解决了单目深度估计在动态环境中的测试时自适应问题，展现了卓越的性能表现。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

*Yuanxiang Huangfu,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色扮演提示指导MLLM生成语义多样化的图像-文本对，在保持数据量不变的情况下提升CLIP模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，导致语义多样性有限、标题冗余或浅显，需要提升语义多样性和细粒度图像-文本对齐。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释器）指导多模态大语言模型从不同视角生成语义多样化的标题。

Result: 仅用100万Role-SynthCLIP对训练的CLIP-B/16模型在MS COCO验证集上Recall@1达到64.1%，比现有最佳合成数据基线（500万对训练）提升2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP框架能有效提升合成数据的语义多样性和质量，显著改善CLIP模型的性能表现。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

TL;DR: 提出SurgiATM手术烟雾去除方法，通过统计建模将物理大气模型与深度学习结合，作为轻量级插件模块提升现有去烟方法的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中组织烧灼产生的烟雾会显著降低内窥镜图像质量，增加手术错误风险，影响临床决策和计算机视觉分析，因此需要有效的烟雾去除方法。

Method: SurgiATM统计性地桥接基于物理的大气模型和数据驱动的深度学习模型，结合前者的泛化能力和后者的高精度，设计为轻量级即插即用模块，仅引入两个超参数且无额外可训练权重。

Result: 在三个公共手术数据集上的实验表明，SurgiATM能普遍降低现有模型的恢复误差，相对增强其泛化能力，且不增加任何可训练层或权重。

Conclusion: SurgiATM具有便利性、低成本、有效性和泛化性优势，可无缝集成到各种手术去烟架构中，更好地满足临床需求。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对抗样本与干净样本的内在差异对于增强DNN鲁棒性和对抗攻击检测至关重要。

Method: 使用九种典型攻击生成对抗样本，引入滑动掩码置信熵(SMCE)量化遮挡下的模型置信度波动，并基于此提出滑动窗口掩码对抗样本检测(SWM-AED)方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对抗样本在遮挡下表现出显著更高的置信度波动，SWM-AED方法在大多数情况下检测准确率超过62%，最高可达96.5%。

Conclusion: 对抗样本对遮挡的敏感性可作为有效的检测特征，SWM-AED方法避免了传统对抗训练的灾难性过拟合问题，具有稳健的检测性能。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

Motivation: 解决现有虚拟数据集构建复杂、领域泛化能力差的问题，在保护数据隐私的同时提升行人重识别模型在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 第一阶段：使用包含外观、光照、视角等多维属性的丰富提示驱动扩散模型端到端合成多样化数据，构建GenePerson虚拟数据集；第二阶段：提出提示驱动解耦机制，通过两个文本反转网络分别映射图像的风格和内容，构建风格解耦的内容提示来学习领域不变特征。

Conclusion: DPPP范式有效解决了虚拟数据集的构建复杂性和领域泛化问题，为隐私保护下的行人重识别提供了可行解决方案，展示了虚拟数据在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Conclusion: 所提出的双层次强化学习框架有效解决了恶劣天气下视觉感知的泛化问题，实现了在真实条件下的持续适应和优异性能。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究首次应用深度学习直接对原始OCT B扫描图像进行阿尔茨海默病早期检测，使用ResNet-34模型在4年队列中达到AUC 0.62，虽低于临床应用阈值但证实了黄斑中央区结构差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究主要关注分割层厚度测量，而本研究探索直接使用OCT B扫描图像进行AD早期分类，因为成像比临床诊断早数年，早期检测更具挑战性。

Method: 微调多个预训练模型（包括ImageNet网络和OCT专用RETFound transformer），使用年龄、性别和成像实例匹配的UK Biobank数据，应用标准及OCT特定增强技术和年加权损失函数。

Result: ResNet-34产生最稳定结果，在4年队列中AUC为0.62，可解释性分析证实AD组与对照组在黄斑中央区存在局部结构差异。

Conclusion: 为基于OCT的AD预测提供了基线，突出了在AD诊断前数年检测细微视网膜生物标志物的挑战，并指出需要更大数据集和多模态方法。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视频中动态场景的新视角合成问题，特别是在未知相机位姿的情况下，现有方法如NeRF和3DGS难以处理动态内容且依赖预计算位姿。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先使用3D基础模型进行初始位姿和几何估计，然后通过运动感知细化。关键技术包括运动感知束调整模块和高效的运动感知高斯泼溅表示。

Result: 在真实世界动态数据集上，PSNR比最先进方法提升1.8dB，在包含大动态物体的挑战性场景中表现优异，计算需求比先前动态场景表示减少5倍。

Conclusion: 4D3R框架在动态场景新视角合成中实现了更好的性能与效率平衡，为未知相机位姿的动态场景渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third

appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

Result: 在RealX-Bench和其他代表性基准测试中表现有效，能够根据任务自适应调用工具（感知任务用图像操作，推理任务用数值计算），强化学习还支持复杂工具组合和上下文感知的工具选择。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发代理式多模态模型提供了指导，证明了强化学习在复杂工具组合和选择性工具调用中的价值。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIXEL是一种简单的知识蒸馏方法，通过让学生模型学习在更高分辨率下重现自身特征图，在保持分辨率固定的情况下显著超越基线DINOv3模型，并能以较低计算成本生成与教师模型相似的特征图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DINOv3模型在高分辨率下计算密集特征图时面临的高计算成本和平方复杂度问题。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，训练学生模型学习在更高分辨率下重现自身特征图。

Result: 在保持分辨率固定的下游任务中大幅超越基线DINOv3模型，能以较低计算成本生成与教师模型相似的特征图。

Conclusion: BRIXEL通过简单的知识蒸馏方法有效解决了高分辨率特征图计算的高成本问题，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

TL;DR: LiveStar是一个开创性的实时流媒体助手，通过自适应流式解码实现持续主动响应，解决了现有在线视频大语言模型在连续帧处理和响应时机确定方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线视频大语言模型通常在同时处理连续帧输入和确定最佳响应时机方面存在困难，往往牺牲实时响应性和叙述连贯性。

Method: LiveStar包含三个关键技术：(1)支持可变长度视频流增量视频-语言对齐的训练策略；(2)通过单次前向传播验证确定最佳主动响应时机的响应-静默解码框架；(3)基于峰值-末端内存压缩的内存感知加速和流式键值缓存。

Conclusion: LiveStar在在线视频理解方面实现了最先进的性能，通过自适应流式解码有效解决了实时响应和叙述连贯性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法严重依赖劳动密集型的细胞核级标注，且难以充分利用大规模未标记数据来学习判别性细胞核表示。

Method: 提出NuLo机制实现基于预测细胞核位置的灵活局部自蒸馏，无需增强视图间的严格空间对齐；设计编码器-解码器架构和大视野半监督微调策略。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试上，MUSE不仅超越最先进的监督基线，还优于通用的病理学基础模型。

Conclusion: MUSE有效解决了组织病理学细胞核检测与分类的核心挑战，为高级病理学应用提供了有力支撑。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了现有点云生成评估指标（特别是基于Chamfer距离的指标）的不足，提出了更稳健的评估方法（DCD和SNC），并开发了新的Diffusion Point Transformer模型，在ShapeNet数据集上实现了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D点云技术的广泛应用，需要更可靠的生成模型和评估指标。现有基于Chamfer距离的评估指标对缺陷不鲁棒，无法充分捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性。

Method: 1. 引入样本对齐预处理和Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD)来改进评估指标；2. 提出Surface Normal Concordance (SNC)指标，通过比较估计的点法向来近似表面相似性；3. 基于transformer的点云分析模型，开发Diffusion Point Transformer架构用于生成高质量3D结构。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提模型在生成点云质量方面优于先前解决方案，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过改进的评估指标和新的生成架构，本文为3D点云生成提供了更可靠的质量评估方法和更高质量的生成模型。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

TL;DR: WtL2是一种改进的轮廓跟踪算法，专门用于红外和RGB图像中船舶及其他物体的精细分割，通过轮廓跟踪替代传统非极大值抑制，生成1像素宽的闭合轮廓。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展原始WtL算法，使其不仅适用于彩色船舶分割，还能处理红外图像中的船舶分割以及RGB图像中的多种物体分割。

Method: 通过轮廓跟踪算法细化物体轮廓，直到形成1像素宽的闭合形状，可在前景-背景场景中形成可分割区域，替代传统的非极大值抑制方法。

Result: WtL2在红外船舶分割和RGB多种物体分割中表现出色，在实现闭合物体轮廓时优于最新的基于轮廓的方法，提供高IoU值和精细细节。

Conclusion: WtL2成为需要精细分割或高质量样本的专业应用的有力方法，有望推动图像分割领域多个细分领域的进展。

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

TL;DR: FreeControl是一个无需训练、基于扩散模型的语义结构控制框架，通过单步注意力提取和潜在条件解耦实现高效的结构引导，支持组合控制，推理成本仅增加约5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型控制方法（如ControlNet）依赖手工条件图和重新训练，灵活性差；基于反转的方法虽然对齐效果好但推理成本高，需要更高效灵活的结构控制方案

Method: 1. 单步注意力提取：从最优关键时间步一次性提取注意力并复用至整个去噪过程；2. 潜在条件解耦(LCD)：分离关键时间步和噪声潜在表示，提升注意力质量和稳定性；3. 组合控制：支持多源参考图像的组合布局设计

Result: FreeControl实现了结构和语义对齐的视觉一致生成，直接从原始图像进行控制，支持直观的组合设计，与现代扩散模型兼容，推理成本仅增加约5%

Conclusion: FreeControl为测试时控制提供了新范式，无需反转或重新训练即可实现高效、灵活的结构控制，在保持高质量生成的同时显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流异常检测方法依赖ImageNet预训练特征，但ImageNet预训练目标与异常检测目标不匹配，且自然图像与工业图像存在分布偏移，导致预训练特征对异常检测任务不够理想。

Method: 提出角度和范数导向的对比损失函数，同时最大化正常与异常特征间的角度和范数差异；在大型工业异常数据集RealIAD上预训练；基于类别泛化表征的残差特征学习预训练表征。

Conclusion: 专门为异常检测任务设计的预训练表征能有效解决ImageNet预训练特征与异常检测目标不匹配的问题，显著提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

TL;DR: MPRF是一种多模态闭环检测方法，结合视觉和LiDAR模态，在非结构化环境中实现稳健的闭环检测和6-DoF位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒止环境（如行星探测）中，视觉位置识别因混叠和弱纹理而失效，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更稳健的闭环检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段视觉检索策略：使用DINOv2特征和SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，结合SONATA LiDAR描述符进行几何验证，集成显式6-DoF位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI和S3LI Vulcano数据集上，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，并在低纹理区域增强了位姿估计的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPRF在准确性、效率和可靠性之间实现了良好平衡，展示了基础模型统一位置识别和位姿估计的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Motivation: 现有时序搜索方法通常依赖手工设计的搜索过程，缺乏端到端优化来学习最优搜索策略，导致搜索效率不高。

Method: 提出TimeSearch-R框架，将时序搜索重新定义为交错式文本-视频思考，采用强化学习（特别是GRPO-CSV方法）来优化搜索策略，通过完整性自验证确保视频内容的充分探索。

Result: 在Haystack-LVBench、Haystack-Ego4D等时序搜索基准以及VideoMME、MLVU等长视频理解基准上取得显著改进，在LongVideoBench上相比基础模型Qwen2.5-VL提升4.1%，相比先进视频推理模型Video-R1提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过将时序搜索重新定义为交错式推理过程，结合强化学习和完整性自验证机制，显著提升了时序搜索和长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

Motivation: 术中准确描绘结直肠肝转移瘤对实现阴性切缘至关重要，但传统术中超声因低对比度、噪声和操作者依赖性而具有挑战性

Method: 使用85个患者的3D iUS数据训练3D U-Net，比较完整体积和裁剪肿瘤区域两种变体，集成到3D Slicer中实时使用

Result: 裁剪体积模型显著优于完整体积模型（AUC-ROC=0.898 vs 0.718），中位DSC=0.74，召回率=0.79，HDist=17.1mm，比半自动分割快约4倍

Conclusion: 该方法为肝脏手术提供高效、无需配准的超声导航，接近专家级精度，同时大幅减少手动工作量和手术时间

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Motivation: 解决传统饮食监测方法（如自我报告存在回忆偏差，摄像头方法涉及隐私问题）的局限性，以及现有可穿戴设备方法主要针对有限食物类型（如汉堡、披萨），无法应对中餐多样性的问题。

Method: 设计两阶段检测流程：第一阶段通过区分特征性时间模式识别进食状态；第二阶段基于进食期间捕获的运动进行细粒度食物类型识别。结合智能手表的手部运动数据和智能眼镜的头部动态数据。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了一个实用解决方案，能够有效应对中餐多样性挑战，系统代码已公开。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition is vital for affective
computing but faces challenges in feature utilization and cross-domain
generalization. This work introduces EmotionCLIP, which reformulates
recognition as an EEG-text matching task within the CLIP framework. A tailored
backbone, SST-LegoViT, captures spatial, spectral, and temporal features using
multi-scale convolution and Transformer modules. Experiments on SEED and
SEED-IV datasets show superior cross-subject accuracies of 88.69% and 73.50%,
and cross-time accuracies of 88.46% and 77.54%, outperforming existing models.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal contrastive learning for
robust EEG emotion recognition.

*Huanqi Wu,Huangbiao Xu,Runfeng Xie,Jiaxin Cai,Kaixin Zhang,Xiao Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的语义隐写方法S²LM，能够将句子级别的语义信息嵌入到图像中，突破了传统比特级隐写的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AIGC时代，隐写术的容量需求日益重要，但现有方法难以嵌入语义丰富的句子级信息。

Method: 设计了S²LM模型，利用LLM在整个过程中参与，通过新设计的流程将高级文本信息（如句子或段落）嵌入图像。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法有效解锁了LLMs的新语义隐写能力。

Conclusion: 提出的句子到图像隐写方法为语义隐写开辟了新方向，能够处理更丰富的语义内容。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

*Manuel Gomes,Bogdan Raducanu,Miguel Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Artic4D数据集和CanonSeg4D框架，用于4D铰接物体全景分割，通过将物体部分映射到规范空间来提升分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铰接物体感知方法大多忽略时间动态特性，4D时序数据在该领域未被充分探索，且缺乏基准数据集。

Method: 提出CanonSeg4D框架，显式估计每帧偏移量将观察到的物体部分映射到学习的规范空间，实现跨帧一致的物体部分对齐。

Result: 在Artic4D数据集上的实验表明，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景下的全景分割精度优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 时间建模和规范对齐在动态物体理解中具有有效性，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动与语言集成研究主要关注文本到运动生成，而运动理解任务相对未被充分探索，当前数据集缺乏详细时序标注且多为短序列

Method: 构建CompMo数据集（6万条多动作运动序列），提出DEMO模型，将大语言模型与简单运动适配器集成，生成密集的时序基础描述

Result: DEMO在CompMo数据集和适应基准上显著优于现有方法，为3D运动理解和描述研究建立了强大基线

Conclusion: 密集运动描述是一个重要但未被充分探索的任务，CompMo数据集和DEMO模型为未来3D运动理解研究提供了坚实基础

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1是一个基于偏好-响应解耦强化学习的视觉质量评估框架，通过统一绝对分数回归和相对排名一致性，在少量数据上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨域泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双分支奖励公式，分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行优化，并设计了全局-时间局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 在仅6K图像和28K视频的强化微调下，在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中取得最先进结果，IQA任务中SRCC和PLCC分别提升5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1不仅实现了量化性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: PALM是一个大规模手部数据集，包含263名受试者的13,000个高质量手部扫描和90,000张多视角图像，用于解决手部建模中的几何、外观和关节复杂性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏准确的3D几何、高分辨率多视角图像和多样化的受试者群体，限制了高质量个性化手部虚拟形象的创建。

Method: 通过基于物理的逆渲染学习多受试者的手部几何和材质属性先验，开发了PALM-Net基线模型，实现从单张图像创建逼真、可重照明的个性化手部虚拟形象。

Result: 构建了包含丰富肤色、年龄和几何变化的大规模数据集，展示了PALM-Net在单图像手部虚拟形象个性化方面的实用性。

Conclusion: PALM数据集的规模和多样性使其成为手部建模及相关研究的宝贵现实世界资源。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的卷积层修改方法，用于持续学习图像修复任务，无需修改主干架构，能够在不显著增加计算开销的情况下适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习在图像修复领域面临独特挑战，现有方法需要大量工程化架构修改，计算开销大。正则化方法不适用于修复任务，因为不同的修复问题需要不同的特征处理方式。

Method: 通过简单修改卷积层来适应先前修复任务的知识，无需改动主干架构，可无缝应用于任何深度架构。该方法能够增加可训练参数而不显著增加计算开销或推理时间。

Result: 实验验证表明，新修复任务的引入不会影响现有任务的性能，且通过适应先前任务创建的知识库，新任务的性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像修复领域的持续学习提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够在不修改主干架构的情况下实现知识迁移和任务适应。

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

TL;DR: 提出基于HierSpeech++潜在语音表示的文本到说话人脸合成框架，通过两阶段训练处理特征分布偏移，实现紧密的视听对齐和自然的面部运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到说话人脸合成中音频和面部运动同步的问题，同时保持说话人身份和自然表达，无需推理时的真实音频。

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，采用两阶段训练：在Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，在TTS输出上微调，以处理干净特征和TTS预测特征之间的分布偏移。

Result: 实验表明，基于TTS预测潜在特征的调节优于级联管道，提高了唇部同步和视觉真实感。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现紧密的视听对齐，保持说话人身份，并生成自然、富有表现力的语音和同步的面部运动，无需推理时的真实音频。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: 本文提出gitmerge3D方法，通过全局信息图token合并技术，在3D点云transformer中减少90-95%的token数量，同时保持竞争性性能，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云transformer模型依赖密集token表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂。研究发现token存在显著冗余，现有模型存在过度标记化和可扩展性优化不足的问题。

Method: 提出gitmerge3D方法，一种全局信息图token合并技术，能够有效减少token数量。该方法通过分析token间的冗余性，进行智能合并。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务上验证，token数量减少90-95%的同时保持竞争性性能，计算效率得到一致提升。这是首个评估大规模3D transformer模型冗余性的工作。

Conclusion: 挑战了"更多token带来更好性能"的普遍假设，揭示了当前模型过度标记化的问题，为开发更高效的3D基础架构提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

TL;DR: 该研究证明中分辨率卫星影像可用于建筑物损毁评估，提出了xBD-S12数据集，并发现复杂模型架构在泛化性上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损毁评估，但超高分辨率影像可用性有限，因此研究中等分辨率地球观测影像是否能够支持建筑物损毁评估。

Method: 引入xBD-S12数据集，包含10,315对Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2的灾前灾后影像对，并进行一系列实验验证建筑物损毁检测能力。

Result: 尽管只有10米地面采样距离，但在许多灾害场景下能够较好地检测和绘制建筑物损毁情况，且复杂模型架构在泛化到未见过的灾害时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 哥白尼影像可成为快速、广域损毁评估的可行数据源，与超高分辨率影像协同发挥作用。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Method: 提出了一个概率框架，结合现代人脸识别和年龄估计模型的视觉证据，以及基于职业的时间先验，来推断照片拍摄年份。

Result: 实验表明，聚合多个面孔的证据能持续提升性能，该方法在包含多个可识别个体的图像中显著优于基于场景的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于人脸信息的方法在照片年代估计中具有显著优势，特别是在多人物图像中，通过信息聚合能获得更好的性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流沸腾热管理需要准确低延迟的实时监测，但传统光学成像方法计算量大、时间分辨率不足，无法捕捉瞬态流动行为

Method: 开发五种分类模型，使用传统图像数据和事件数据，其中基于事件数据的LSTM模型在精度和速度上表现最佳

Result: 基于事件的LSTM模型达到97.6%的分类准确率，处理时间仅0.28毫秒，异步处理管道支持连续低延迟预测

Conclusion: 神经形态传感器的事件数据能够有效捕捉动态流动特征，为实验控制和智能热管理提供可靠的实时反馈

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,

TL;DR: GroupKAN是一种轻量级医学图像分割网络，通过分组KAN变换和分组KAN激活模块，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了参数数量和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学图像分割模型中卷积架构缺乏自适应非线性、Transformer架构计算复杂度高且可解释性差的问题，特别是U-KAN模型在通道数增加时的O(C^2)复杂度限制。

Method: 提出两个结构化功能模块：(1)分组KAN变换，将通道划分为G组进行多元样条映射，复杂度降至O(C^2/G)；(2)分组KAN激活，在每个通道组内应用共享的样条映射实现高效的token-wise非线性。

Result: 在三个医学基准数据集(BUSI、GlaS、CVC)上平均IoU达到79.80%，比U-KAN提升1.11%，参数数量仅为U-KAN的47.6%(3.02M vs 6.35M)。

Conclusion: GroupKAN在保持高分割精度的同时，显著降低了模型复杂度和参数数量，并提高了可解释性，为医学图像分割提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [68] [Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning Over Ordered Procedural Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04688)
*Adrita Anika,Md Messal Monem Miah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在程序性序列推理任务中的表现，使用食谱数据集重建打乱的步骤顺序，发现模型性能随序列长度增加和步骤位移加剧而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性序列推理是大语言模型的关键能力，步骤顺序直接影响结果。研究旨在评估LLMs在重建全局有序序列方面的表现，特别是在需要正确排序的任务领域。

Method: 使用食谱数据集，在零样本和少样本设置下评估多个LLMs。采用综合评估框架，包括Kendall's Tau、NLCS和NED等排序和序列对齐指标。

Result: 模型性能随序列长度增加而下降，反映了更复杂程序的额外难度。输入中步骤位移越大（即打乱程度越严重），性能下降越明显。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在程序性推理方面存在局限性，特别是在处理更长和更无序的输入时表现不佳。

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个基于项目反应理论(IRT)的自适应测试框架，通过Fisher信息指导的项目选择来估计模型能力，可在保持测量精度的同时减少90%的测试项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型评估需要数千个基准项目，成本高且速度慢，且所有项目被平等对待，忽略了项目质量和信息量的差异。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)和Fisher信息指导的项目选择方法，动态选择最具信息量的测试项目来估计模型能力。

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上仅用42个项目(原5,608个)就达到全基准估计效果，MAE为0.154；发现3-6%的项目存在负区分度；IRT排名与传统准确率排名存在显著差异。

Conclusion: ATLAS框架显著提高了评估效率，揭示了静态基准中的标注错误问题，并为模型能力提供了更精细的测量。

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at
https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/ATLAS.git.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SARC框架，通过情感增强的深度聚类识别用户角色，结合角色聚类和假新闻检测的联合优化目标，在假新闻检测任务上取得优于基线模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将情感特征作为辅助信号，忽视了用户角色差异——相同情感极性可能来自不同角色的用户，这限制了模型捕捉细微模式的能力。

Method: SARC框架：1) 使用BiGRU和注意力机制生成用户特征；2) 构建可微分深度聚类模块自动分类用户角色；3) 提出结合角色聚类和假新闻检测的联合优化目标。

Result: 在RumourEval-19和Weibo-comp两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，SARC在所有指标上都优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过考虑用户角色差异并整合角色聚类与假新闻检测，SARC框架能够更有效地检测假新闻，证明了用户角色分析在假新闻检测中的重要性。

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将指令层次结构解析重新定义为推理任务，通过构建VerIH数据集和轻量级强化学习训练，使LLM能够优先处理系统指令而非用户指令，从而提高模型可靠性和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实决策中承担高风险角色，需要处理来自多个来源（如模型开发者、用户和工具）的竞争性指令。强制执行指令层次结构对于LLM的可靠性和可控性至关重要。

Method: 将指令层次结构解析重构为推理任务，构建VerIH数据集（包含对齐和冲突的系统-用户指令），使用轻量级强化学习训练模型优先处理更高优先级的指令。

Result: 微调后的模型在指令遵循和指令层次基准测试中取得一致改进，推理能力能够泛化到训练分布之外的安全关键场景，增强了对越狱和提示注入攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过指令层次结构的推理为可靠LLM提供了实用路径，系统提示的更新能够产生可控和鲁棒的模型行为变化。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

Conclusion: 微调transformer在敏感情境下提供可靠且可解释的检测，multiMentalRoBERTa作为轻量级、鲁棒且可部署的解决方案，可增强心理健康平台的支持能力。

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

TL;DR: WinnowRAG是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过两阶段处理来过滤噪声文档同时保留有价值内容，提高RAG系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法通过增加检索文档数量来提高相关性，但会引入大量噪声文档，反而降低生成响应的准确性。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段进行查询感知聚类，将相似文档分组并由LLM代理生成答案；第二阶段进行筛选，由评判LLM评估多个代理输出并迭代分离有用文档与噪声文档。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，WinnowRAG在效果上优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: WinnowRAG是一个模型无关且无需微调的框架，能有效处理大量文档中的噪声问题，在各种任务中具有良好适应性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does
not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.
Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment
sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii)
Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded
tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the
Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and
application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel
dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy
rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement
adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on
POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models
maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the
difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we
successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型训练样本影响估计方法由于计算限制通常只使用部分层，先前研究认为嵌入层最适合，但本文发现这种基于抵消效应的假设不可靠。

Method: 提出理论和实证证据证明抵消效应不可靠，发现中间注意力层是更好的影响估计器，提出排名和投票等替代标准平均的聚合方法，并引入新的评估指标NDR。

Result: 通过在不同类型和规模的LLM上进行广泛实验，明确确定第一层（嵌入层）不一定比最后一层更适合LLM影响估计，这与该领域先前的认知形成对比。

Conclusion: 中间注意力层比嵌入层更适合训练样本影响估计，新的聚合方法和NDR指标能显著提升性能，挑战了该领域的传统认知。

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

Result: 在包含280种罕见疾病的NOVA数据集上，RADAR实现了最高10.2%的性能提升，特别是对开源模型如DeepSeek效果最显著。

Conclusion: 检索增强推理为医学影像中的低患病率疾病提供了强大的解决方案，不仅能提高准确性，还能提供基于文献的可解释性说明。

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence
conditions in medical imaging.

*Nikolai Ilinykh,Simon Dobnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于信息熵方差的图像描述多样性度量方法，发现使用不同评分器会完全反转人类与模型多样性的比较结论


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化图像描述任务中的语言多样性，比较人类与模型在生成多样性方面的差异

Method: 使用信息熵方差作为多样性度量指标，在MSCOCO测试集上比较5个先进视觉语言模型和人类描述，分别使用基于描述的n-gram语言模型和通用语言模型进行评分

Result: 使用基于描述的LM时，人类的信息熵方差约为模型的两倍；但使用通用LM重新评分后，模式完全反转

Conclusion: 单一评分器可能导致结论完全反转，稳健的多样性评估需要在多个评分器下报告信息熵

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report
surprisal under several scorers.

TL;DR: ERPO框架通过探索残差提示来增强RLVR训练效果，通过历史追踪和自适应温度调整来重新激活零方差奖励提示的训练信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型训练时间延长和规模扩大，越来越多的训练提示变成残差提示（零方差奖励），减少了训练信号的多样性，限制了模型效果。

Method: ERPO维护每个提示的历史追踪器，自适应增加残差提示的采样温度，鼓励生成更多样化的推理轨迹，引入错误响应来重新激活训练信号。

Result: 在Qwen2.5系列上的实证结果显示，ERPO在多个数学推理基准测试中持续超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: ERPO框架能有效利用残差提示，通过探索策略重新激活训练信号，提升强化学习验证奖励方法的训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

*Preetum Nakkiran,Arwen Bradley,Adam Goliński,Eugene Ndiaye,Michael Kirchhof,Sinead Williamson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现基础LLMs在语义校准方面表现良好，能够有意义地评估开放域问答任务中的置信度，尽管没有经过专门训练。理论揭示了语义校准作为下一个token预测副产品的机制，并发现RL指令微调和思维链推理会破坏这种校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常缺乏对其输出的有意义的置信度估计。虽然基础LLMs已知具有下一个token校准能力，但尚不清楚它们是否能在token级别之外评估其响应的实际含义的置信度。

Method: 使用基于采样的语义校准概念，建立B-校准理论框架，将校准与局部损失最优性联系起来。通过实验验证三个理论预测：基础LLMs的语义校准、RL指令微调破坏校准、思维链推理破坏校准。

Result: 基础LLMs在问答任务中表现出语义校准能力；RL指令微调会系统性地破坏这种校准；链式思维推理也会破坏校准。

Conclusion: 该研究首次为LLMs中语义校准何时以及为何出现提供了原理性解释，揭示了语义校准作为下一个token预测副产品的机制，并指出了当前优化方法可能破坏这种内在校准能力的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs可以通过简单的低秩适配器(LoRA)获得行为自意识能力，这种能力表现为领域特定的线性特征，可以被轻松诱导和调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs行为自意识的产生条件和机制，因为这种能力可能带来安全隐患，比如让模型在评估时更好地隐藏真实能力。

Method: 通过在指令调优的LLMs上使用低秩适配器(LoRA)进行受控微调实验，特别是使用单秩-1 LoRA适配器。

Result: (1) 使用单秩-1 LoRA适配器可以可靠地诱导自意识；(2) 习得的行为自意识可以通过激活空间中的单个导向向量捕获；(3) 自意识是非普适且领域局部化的，在不同任务间有独立表征。

Conclusion: 行为自意识作为领域特定的线性特征出现，可以轻松诱导和调节，这对AI安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDS KoPub VDR是首个大规模公开的韩文公共文档检索基准，包含361个真实文档（40,781页）和600个经过人工验证的查询-页面-答案三元组，支持文本检索和多模态检索两种任务评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉文档检索基准主要关注英文文档，忽视了非英语语言和官方出版物的结构复杂性，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 基于361个真实韩文公共文档构建语料库，使用多模态模型生成查询并经过严格人工验证，将查询按推理模式分为文本型、视觉型和跨模态型，评估文本检索和多模态检索两种任务。

Result: 评估揭示了显著的性能差距，特别是在需要跨模态推理的多模态场景中，即使是当前最先进的模型也存在明显不足。

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR作为基础资源，不仅支持文本和多模态检索任务的严格评估，还为推进复杂现实文档智能中的多模态AI提供了清晰路线图。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BudgetMem是一种新颖的内存增强架构，通过选择性记忆策略和基于特征的显著性评分，在严格预算约束下学习存储重要信息，相比传统RAG系统节省72.4%内存且性能仅下降1.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理长上下文时面临显著的计算和内存约束，尽管应用需求增长，但现有方法在资源受限部署中成本过高。

Method: 结合选择性记忆策略与基于特征的显著性评分（实体密度、TF-IDF、语篇标记、位置偏差），使用学习门控机制和BM25稀疏检索进行高效信息访问。

Result: 在700个问答对上的实验显示，BudgetMem在长文档上仅产生1.0% F1分数下降，同时节省72.4%内存，且随着文档长度增加效益更明显。

Conclusion: BudgetMem为在有限硬件上部署能力强的长上下文系统提供了实用途径，使先进语言理解能力更加普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法推进了实验设计的可靠、可解释自动化，为科学研究提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable
automation of experimental design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata作为最大的开放知识图谱，其宽松的编辑政策导致了分类不一致性问题，需要系统性的验证和纠正方法。

Method: 提出并应用新的验证方法来确认分类错误、过度泛化的子类链接和冗余连接，开发用户检查系统。

Result: 确认了特定领域中存在分类错误、过度泛化的子类链接和冗余连接问题。

Conclusion: 通过利用众包特性，开发了能够有效检测和纠正Wikidata分类不一致性的系统。

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理场景对大型语言模型越来越重要，但带来了显著的计算延迟。现有并行分词方法通过文本分割和多进程分词加速处理，但由于合并后的边界伪影导致结果不一致。

Method: 提出LoPT框架，采用基于字符位置的匹配和动态块长度调整策略，准确对齐和合并分词片段，确保无损分词。

Result: 在多种长文本数据集上的实验表明，LoPT实现了显著的速度提升，同时保证无损分词。

Conclusion: LoPT通过理论一致性证明和全面分析研究验证了方法的鲁棒性，为长文本分词提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在模拟非亲社会、反派角色时的能力限制，特别是安全对齐如何影响角色扮演的真实性。

Method: 引入Moral RolePlay基准，包含四级道德对齐量表，让最先进的LLMs扮演从道德典范到纯粹反派的不同角色。

Result: 随着角色道德水平下降，角色扮演保真度呈现一致、单调的下降趋势。模型在处理与安全原则直接对立的特质时表现最差。

Conclusion: 安全对齐与创意保真度之间存在关键张力，需要开发更细致、上下文感知的对齐方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

TL;DR: 提出了PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE)评估套件，用于系统评估大语言模型在多轮交互对话中遵守多元化对齐规范的能力。研究发现现有模型在单轮设置中表现良好，但在多轮对抗性交互中合规性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM应用通常发生在具有独特企业政策、监管要求和使用场景的组织生态系统中，这凸显了对具有多元化对齐目标的LLM进行严格评估的需求。

Method: 开发了PBSUITE评估套件，包含基于30个行业的300个现实LLM行为策略数据集，以及用于在对抗条件下压力测试模型合规性的动态评估框架。

Result: 领先的开源和闭源LLM在单轮设置中保持稳健的行为策略遵守（失败率低于4%），但在多轮对抗性交互中合规性大幅减弱（失败率高达84%）。

Conclusion: 现有模型对齐和安全调节方法在真实世界LLM交互中无法连贯地执行多元化行为策略，需要开发更稳健和情境感知的多元化对齐技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource
languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on
widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural

### [94] [Order-Level Attention Similarity Across Language Models: A Latent Commonality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05064)
*Jinglin Liang,Jin Zhong,Shuangping Huang,Yunqing Hu,Huiyuan Zhang,Huifang Li,Lixin Fan,Hanlin Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上存在共性，提出了基于注意力展开的Order-Level Attention(OLA)方法，揭示了OLA与句法知识的隐式映射关系，并开发了无需训练的跨模型适配器TOA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上的共性，这有助于加深对语言模型的理解并促进跨模型知识迁移。现有研究通常关注单个模型或注意力头，缺乏系统性分析。

Method: 引入基于注意力展开的Order-Level Attention(OLA)，发现不同语言模型在同阶OLA上存在显著相似性；提出Transferable OLA Adapter(TOA)，将OLA作为统一的句法特征表示，训练适配器并实现跨模型泛化。

Result: 实验证明TOA能够有效提升未见语言模型的性能，适配器无需参数更新即可泛化到新模型。

Conclusion: 不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上存在系统性共性，OLA可作为有效的跨模型句法特征表示，TOA方法实现了训练自由的跨模型适配器迁移。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种多语言虚假信息检测的声明规范化方法，通过系统分解社交媒体帖子为可验证陈述，在20种语言上实现跨语言迁移，仅使用英语数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言虚假信息检测中的声明规范化问题，将嘈杂的社交媒体帖子转化为清晰可验证的陈述，实现跨语言迁移。

Method: 使用Qwen3-14B模型进行LoRA微调，结合帖子内去重、语义对齐的token级召回过滤，以及推理时的检索增强少样本学习。

Result: 在20种语言上取得METEOR分数从41.16(英语)到15.21(马拉地语)，英语排行榜第三名，荷兰语和旁遮普语第四名，相比基线配置提升41.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在罗曼语系和日耳曼语系语言上实现了有效的跨语言泛化，在不同语言结构中保持语义连贯性。

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection -
transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across
20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of
posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust
cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our
methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided
dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for
semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual
examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16
(English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard
and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative
improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over
existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization
for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across
diverse linguistic structures.

*P. Bilha Githinji,Aikaterini Meilliou,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了两种通用大语言模型在文本简化任务中的表现，发现指令调优的Mistral 24B在可读性和话语保真度之间取得更好平衡，而推理增强的QWen2.5 32B在平衡方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公众健康信息需求和数字消费的增加，需要可扩展的解决方案来自动将复杂的科学和技术文档简化为通俗语言，但现有文本简化方法在可读性和内容保真度之间难以平衡。

Method: 采用比较分析方法，评估指令调优的Mistral 24B和推理增强的QWen2.5 32B两种通用LLM，使用21个指标涵盖可读性、话语保真度、内容安全性和分布度量。

Result: Mistral在SARI指标上达到42.46，BERTScore为0.91，表现出温和的词汇简化策略；QWen虽然可读性提升，但BERTScore显著较低(0.89)，在平衡可读性和准确性方面存在脱节。

Conclusion: 研究为文本简化任务建立了LLM的基线性能，确定指令调优的Mistral 24B更适合简化任务，提供了指标选择的启发式方法，并指出词汇支持是简化的主要领域适应问题。

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

*Grigory Kovalev,Mikhail Tikhomirov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ShortGPT的改进蒸馏方法，通过迭代评估层重要性来压缩大语言模型，将Qwen2.5-3B从36层减少到28层(2.47B参数)仅损失9.7%性能，24层损失18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发紧凑模型以保持高性能，解决大语言模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题。

Method: 基于ShortGPT的改进方法，结合迭代层重要性评估（通过移除单层测量性能退化）和使用KL散度和均方误差的联合损失函数进行进一步训练。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B模型上，层数从36减少到28层(2.47B参数)仅损失9.7%质量，减少到24层损失18%质量。发现中间transformer层对推理贡献较小。

Conclusion: 迭代蒸馏和微调方法有效，适合在资源受限环境中部署，证明了中间层在推理中的重要性较低，为创建高效模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 现有的进化提示优化方法缺乏鲁棒的算子和高效的评估机制，需要改进以提升优化效果。

Method: 1) 将进化分解为不同步骤以增强控制和进化效果；2) 引入基于LLM的验证器来验证进化结果；3) 整合人类反馈来优化进化算子；4) 开发更高效的评估策略以减少计算开销。

Result: 该方法在优化质量和效率方面均有提升，代码已开源支持新任务的提示优化。

Conclusion: 提出的改进方法能够部分泛化到一般提示优化中，为这一领域的研究提供了有效工具和进一步探索的基础。

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用Transformer编码器在制造业等专业领域表现不佳，因为缺乏对领域特定术语和语义的接触。

Method: 提出一个全面的数据处理流程，包括领域特定过滤和多阶段去重过程，创建制造业语料库，并基于此持续预训练RoBERTa模型。

Conclusion: 该管道为在其他专业领域开发高性能编码器提供了可复制的示例，模型和语料库将在HuggingFace上发布。

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

Motivation: 研究不同语言模型在数学领域跨语言性能表现，验证是否存在真实的语言能力差距。

Method: 分析MGSM数据集中的翻译错误，提出自动质量保证方法，并改进答案提取标准化流程。

Result: 修正数据错误和标准化答案提取后，先前观察到的语言性能差距基本消失，得出了与原始研究完全不同的结论。

Conclusion: 多语言数学基准中的语言性能差距主要是数据质量问题造成的，而非模型能力差异，强调了数据质量对评估结果的重要性。

Abstract: Most current large language models (LLMs) support a wide variety of languages
in addition to English, including high-resource languages (e.g. German,
Chinese, French), as well as low-resource ones (e.g. Swahili, Telugu). In
addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains,
like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example
domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages.
Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap
in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat
against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages.
We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual
capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact
that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math
benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in
the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM
outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic
quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations
to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the
aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different
conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to
the community.

Motivation: 探索思维链（CoT）在将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到小型语言模型中的作用，分析其在提升蒸馏模型性能方面的有效性。

Method: 使用Qwen和Llama2系列模型进行白盒知识蒸馏实验，采用CoT-Collection数据集中的思维链数据，在BIG-Bench-Hard基准测试上评估蒸馏模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，思维链显著提高了白盒知识蒸馏的效果，使蒸馏模型在BIG-Bench-Hard的自然语言推理和理解任务中获得了更好的平均性能。

Conclusion: 思维链在白盒知识蒸馏中扮演重要角色，能够有效提升小型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

Conclusion: 该方法可作为大语言模型的补充方案，在特定翻译标注任务中提供有效支持。

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPO提出了一种新的个性化框架，通过解耦内容生成和对齐过程，采用两阶段方法：基础模型生成通用响应，然后反射模块重写输出以适应用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖上下文注入，将用户历史嵌入提示中直接指导生成过程，但这种单步范式让模型同时承担生成准确内容和适应用户风格的双重负担，导致输出质量妥协和控制精度受限。

Method: RPO采用两阶段方法：1）基础模型生成高质量通用响应；2）外部反射模块重写输出以适应用户偏好。反射模块通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试上的综合实验表明，RPO通过解耦内容生成和个性化过程，显著优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: RPO证明了显式响应塑造优于隐式上下文注入，并引入了一个高效、模型无关的个性化层，可与任何基础模型无缝集成，为用户中心生成场景开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一种针对播客内容分析的微调BERT模型，通过将叙事框架与对话中提到的具体实体关联起来，解决了现有LLM在处理非结构化、对话式播客数据时识别叙事框架的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 播客已成为塑造公众舆论的重要媒介，但其非脚本化、多主题和对话式的特点使得自动分析变得困难。现有大型语言模型在处理这类非结构化数据时难以捕捉人类听众依赖的细微线索来识别叙事框架。

Method: 开发并评估了一个微调的BERT模型，明确将叙事框架与对话中提到的具体实体联系起来，将抽象框架锚定在具体细节上。然后使用这些细粒度的框架标签并将其与高级主题相关联，以揭示更广泛的话语趋势。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的框架标记方法，更接近人类对混乱对话数据的判断，并揭示了讨论内容（主题）与呈现方式（框架）之间的系统性关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究数字媒体影响力提供了一个更强大的框架，能够更准确地分析播客叙事结构，理解当代话语的形成机制。

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲大陆法院判决中包含丰富的犯罪行为描述信息，但这些信息在刑事司法行政数据中未被充分利用，本研究旨在探索从公开判决中自动提取这些描述的方法。

Method: 使用两种方法：正则表达式（基础版和高级版）和大型语言模型（Gemini Flash 2.0）。基础正则表达式识别描述前后的典型词汇，高级版关注"sparing"及其规范化形式，LLM方法使用预定义指令提取描述。

Result: 基础方法仅识别40.5%的描述，高级正则表达式达到97%，LLM达到98.75%，两者结合达到99.5%。法学学生评估显示，高级方法在约90%情况下与人工标注匹配，而基础方法仅为34.5%。

Conclusion: 正则表达式和LLM都能有效从法庭判决中提取犯罪描述，两者结合效果最佳，为刑事司法数据分析提供了可靠的技术手段。

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

TL;DR: 提出了BengaliBPE，一个专门为孟加拉语脚本设计的BPE分词器，通过Unicode规范化、字素级初始化和形态感知合并规则来改善对形态丰富语言的分词效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词器如SentencePiece或HuggingFace BPE主要针对拉丁语或多语言语料库设计，在形态丰富的语言如孟加拉语上表现不佳，需要专门的语言感知分词方法。

Method: 开发了BengaliBPE分词器，采用Unicode规范化、字素级初始化和形态感知合并规则，并与Whitespace、SentencePiece BPE和HuggingFace BPE三个基线方法在孟加拉语新闻分类数据集上进行比较。

Result: 所有方法表现都合理，但BengaliBPE提供了最详细的分割和最佳的形态可解释性，尽管计算成本稍高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言感知分词对形态丰富脚本的重要性，BengaliBPE为未来孟加拉语NLP系统（包括大规模预训练语言模型）奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual
language models.

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive
load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over
the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies
have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word
recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel
activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll
et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals
who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in
various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language
Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of
the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak
multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who
investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental
lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by
Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer
network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design
extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex
model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their
corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the
mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language
influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the
presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants'
proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

*Tiago Dinis,Miguel Correia,Roger Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RAGRecon系统，结合检索增强生成(RAG)和大型语言模型(LLM)获取网络安全威胁情报，并通过知识图谱提高AI决策的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全机制难以应对日益复杂的网络威胁，LLM在文本处理和生成方面的先进能力为网络安全提供了重要潜力。

Method: 使用LLM与RAG结合，通过实时信息检索和领域特定数据获取威胁情报，并为每个回复生成可视化知识图谱。

Result: 在两个数据集和七个不同LLM上的实验评估显示，最佳组合的响应与参考响应的匹配率超过91%。

Conclusion: RAGRecon系统成功提高了网络安全威胁情报获取的效率和AI决策的透明度与可解释性。

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity, traditional security
mechanisms struggle to keep up. Large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text
processing and generation. This paper explores the use of LLMs with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining
real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system,
RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats.
Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by
generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every
reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of
the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the
system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon
experimentally with two datasets and seven different LLMs and the responses
matched the reference responses more than 91% of the time for the best
combinations.

### [109] [Minority-Aware Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue Systems via Preference-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05407)
*Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架来建模个体和群体层面的用户满意度偏好，通过个性化推理链和多数-少数偏好感知聚类来改善对话系统的用户满意度估计，特别是针对少数用户群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统对齐方法通常训练一刀切的模型追求广泛共识，往往忽视少数群体视角和用户特定适应性，导致少数用户可能因个体意图和偏好差异而给出不同的满意度评分。

Method: 1. Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) 通过可解释推理链捕捉个体偏好；2. 基于期望最大化的多数-少数偏好感知聚类算法 (M2PC) 无监督发现不同用户群体；3. 偏好自适应强化学习框架 (PAda-PPO) 联合优化个体和群体偏好对齐。

Result: 在情感支持对话数据集上的实验表明，用户满意度估计得到持续改进，特别是对于代表性不足的用户群体。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模个体和群体层面的用户偏好，显著提升对话系统的用户满意度估计性能，特别是对少数群体的适应性。

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

### [110] [Steering Language Models with Weight Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05408)
*Constanza Fierro,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为对比权重导向的简单后训练方法，通过权重算术编辑模型参数，利用狭窄训练数据更好地控制模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模语言模型的多样化训练分布上提供高质量反馈既困难又昂贵，而仅在狭窄分布上提供反馈可能导致意外的泛化问题。

Method: 通过减去两个小规模微调的权重增量来隔离权重空间中的行为方向——一个诱导期望行为，另一个诱导相反行为——然后添加或移除该方向来修改模型权重。

Result: 权重导向比激活导向具有更好的泛化能力，在降低通用能力之前实现更强的分布外行为控制；在任务特定微调中能部分减轻不良行为漂移；初步证据表明可以通过测量微调更新与'邪恶'权重方向的相似性来检测新兴的不对齐。

Conclusion: 对比权重导向是一种有效的后训练方法，能够更好地利用狭窄训练数据控制模型行为，并可能用于监测训练过程中的不对齐行为演化。

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that
never manifest during training or evaluations.

*Yuexin Wu,Shiqi Wang,Vasile Rus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MIMIC-SR-ICD11数据集和LL-Rank重排序框架，用于基于临床报告的疾病诊断，通过似然重排序方法显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病诊断是现代医疗的核心，但电子健康记录往往遗漏临床重要信号，特别是细微但关键的细节。需要利用自我报告中的信息来改善诊断准确性。

Method: 构建MIMIC-SR-ICD11数据集，并提出LL-Rank框架——基于似然的重排序方法，计算给定临床报告上下文的标签联合似然，并减去无报告先验似然。

Result: 在七个模型骨干上，LL-Rank持续优于强基线方法GenMap。消融实验表明LL-Rank的改进主要来自其基于PMI的评分，能够将语义兼容性与标签频率偏差分离。

Conclusion: LL-Rank框架通过似然重排序有效提升了临床诊断的准确性，解决了标签频率偏差问题，为基于临床报告的疾病诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

*Yawei Cai,Jiapeng Mi,Nan Ji,Haotian Rong,Yawei Zhang,Zhangti Li,Wenbin Guo,Rensong Xie*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出动态自适应融合(DAFM)方法，通过多模型协作解决组合图像检索中的特征融合和相似性匹配问题，在CIRR和FashionIQ基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合图像检索方法依赖单一模型同时处理特征融合和相似性匹配，面临两个主要挑战：单一模型难以同时关注整体和细节，缺乏动态权重分配导致嵌入表示偏离目标。

Method: DAFM方法利用异构模型的互补优势，自适应地重新平衡它们的贡献，实现多模型协作，确保性能增益与融合顺序无关。

Result: 在CIRR数据集上Recall@10达到93.21，Rmean达到84.43；在FashionIQ数据集上平均Rmean达到67.48，比现有基线方法提升高达4.5%。

Conclusion: 动态多模型协作为组合图像检索提供了有效且通用的解决方案，显著提升了检索准确性。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve
target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a
modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform
feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major
challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny
details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same
weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and
text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive
leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts
away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for
multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in
isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models
and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes
retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent
of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments
on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our
method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an
average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up
to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides
an effective and general solution for CIR.

TL;DR: 比较传统3D表示方法（点云、体素网格、三角网格）与现代神经隐式方法（NeRF、3DGS）在军事地理空间数据应用中的优劣，提出结合两者优势的混合架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理空间传感器数据对现代国防和安全至关重要，但现有3D表示方法各有局限：传统方法几何精度高但视觉效果差，现代方法视觉效果逼真但几何可靠性不足。

Method: 对传统方法（点云、体素网格、三角网格）和现代神经隐式方法（NeRF、3DGS）进行对比分析，评估它们在几何精度和视觉保真度方面的表现。

Result: 分析发现基本权衡：传统模型在几何精度方面表现稳健，适合视线分析和物理模拟等功能性任务；现代方法能产生高保真度的逼真视觉效果，但几何可靠性往往不足。

Conclusion: 提出混合方法是最有前景的发展方向：结合传统网格支架的几何完整性和3DGS等神经表示的视觉细节，在分层场景结构中管理以确保可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Geospatial sensor data is essential for modern defense and security, offering
indispensable 3D information for situational awareness. This data, gathered
from sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of
detailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a
comparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point
clouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit
techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models
offer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight
analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing
high-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability.
Based on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most
promising path forward. We propose a system architecture that combines a
traditional mesh scaffold for geometric integrity with a neural representation
like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within a hierarchical scene structure to
ensure scalability and performance.

Motivation: 为了在基于图像的深度学习系统中生成平滑且任意长度的路径，同时提供保真度与简洁性之间的参数化权衡控制，以及几何和图像空间中的风格化控制。

Method: 通过线性映射将平滑B样条集成到标准可微分向量图形（DiffVG）管道中，利用基于导数的平滑成本进行参数控制。

Result: 开发了兼容现有向量图形生成和矢量化方法的管道，并在四个应用中展示了其多功能性：风格化空间填充路径生成、基于笔画的图像抽象、封闭区域图像抽象和风格化文本生成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了平滑路径生成与风格化控制的集成，为向量图形生成提供了灵活且多功能的新工具。

Abstract: We integrate smoothing B-splines into a standard differentiable vector
graphics (DiffVG) pipeline through linear mapping, and show how this can be
used to generate smooth and arbitrarily long paths within image-based deep
learning systems. We take advantage of derivative-based smoothing costs for
parametric control of fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs, while also enabling
stylization control in geometric and image spaces. The proposed pipeline is
compatible with recent vector graphics generation and vectorization methods. We
demonstrate the versatility of our approach with four applications aimed at the
generation of stylized vector graphics: stylized space-filling path generation,
stroke-based image abstraction, closed-area image abstraction, and stylized
text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝选项方法仅关注偶然不确定性，但在数据有限的实际场景中，认知不确定性不可忽视。需要一种能识别训练数据不足区域的预测框架。

Method: 基于贝叶斯学习，重新定义最优预测器为最小化期望遗憾的预测器，当输入导致的遗憾超过指定拒绝成本时拒绝预测。

Result: 这是第一个原则性框架，能够学习识别训练数据不足以做出可靠决策的输入。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用中处理数据不足导致的认知不确定性提供了理论依据和实用方法。

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖静态检索，无法适应意图演变和内容漂移，需要动态调整机制。

Method: DMA将文档级、列表级和响应级信号整合到学习流程中：监督训练点对和列表排序器，基于响应级偏好的策略优化，以及知识蒸馏到轻量级评分器。

Result: 在线部署显示人类参与度显著提升，离线测试在对话QA任务上表现优异，同时保持基础检索竞争力。

Conclusion: DMA为RAG系统提供了基于反馈的实时自适应原则性方法，兼顾动态适应和基础能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

Method: 构建实时推理环境，研究反应式智能体（有限推理计算）和规划式智能体（扩展推理计算）两种范式，并提出同时使用两种范式的AgileThinker方法。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型也难以在任一范式中同时做出逻辑性和及时性的判断。AgileThinker在任务难度和时间压力增加时始终优于单一范式的智能体。

Conclusion: 实时推理是开发实用智能体的关键测试平台，为时间约束AI系统研究提供了基础，指明了实现实时能力智能体的路径。

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Motivation: 美国能源部站点的高风险财产分类至关重要，传统专家工作流程耗时、易积压且难以跟上不断变化的法规边界，需要更高效透明的解决方案。

Method: 使用小型协作代理（检索、描述精炼、分类器、验证器、反馈记录器）通过代理间消息协调，利用模型上下文协议实现模型无关的本地操作，采用从物品到证据再到决策的循环界面。

Result: 在真实高风险财产案例的初步测试中，ORCHID相比非代理基线提高了准确性和可追溯性，同时将不确定项目交由主题专家处理。

Conclusion: ORCHID展示了在敏感能源部合规工作流程中实现可信赖大语言模型辅助的实用路径，具有可导出的审计工件和基于政策的决策能力。

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use
equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export
control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional
expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep
pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic
system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM
assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

Result: 框架展示了AI智能体如何通过系统探索解决方案空间、验证法规合规性和透明地权衡利弊来增强人类规划者，而不是取代人类判断。

Conclusion: 该框架表明AI智能体可以通过计算推理能力增强人类规划者，实现基于价值的推理、规则约束的决策和可解释的规划建议，填补了统计学习无法满足的推理需求。

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.
