Conclusion: 

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

Conclusion: 

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)

show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a

temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate

process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable

time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical

backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,

pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are

creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle

multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation

token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention

the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic

Conclusion: 

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is

training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to

with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for

non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their

scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual

techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and

State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,

internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and

moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language

methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to

affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing

However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for

Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising

problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant

approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =

(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and

adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,

LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted

Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,

decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model

emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of

semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context

mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging

AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with

the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response

rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length

LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable

consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly

Conclusion: 

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled

Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models

(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide

generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on

unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.
