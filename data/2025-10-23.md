Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入各种真实环境。通过编码器网络对图像进行视觉上细微的修改，生成的标记可以打印在表面上，为增强现实、机器人技术等应用提供隐蔽的6自由度位置跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学和其他原因下因其显眼外观而不受欢迎，需要一种能够隐蔽融入环境的标记解决方案。

Method: 采用端到端流程，联合训练一系列网络模块来创建和检测Ninja Codes，灵感来自深度隐写术的先前工作。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能够提供可靠的位置跟踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中具有特殊价值，可以使用普通彩色打印机在常规打印纸上打印，任何配备现代RGB摄像头并能运行推理的设备都可以检测。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段视觉语言问答系统，用于自动驾驶场景，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升自动驾驶系统中对高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答能力，需要开发能够有效结合视觉输入和语言理解的系统。

Method: 第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B），输入六摄像头数据、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增强提示，加入场景元数据和任务特定指令。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中，第一阶段使用5历史帧和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率，自一致性集成提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%总体准确率，在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文增强可以显著提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，用于解决纵向医学影像分析中高分辨率图像序列在非均匀时间间隔下的建模挑战，通过连续时间选择性扫描机制和多尺度3D邻域融合模块，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学影像分析面临数据挑战：如何有效建模高分辨率图像序列在非均匀时间间隔下的时空信息。现有方法要么压缩空间信息，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步的时空模型。

Method: 开发了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D状态空间架构，核心创新包括：连续时间选择性扫描机制（显式整合真实时间间隔到状态转移）和多尺度3D邻域融合模块（稳健捕捉时空关系）。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型的运动生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间连贯和物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对复杂运动理解不够。现有方法通过视频编码器特征对齐，但这些特征混合了视频外观和动态信息，限制了改进效果。

Method: 学习一个解耦的运动子空间，该子空间经过优化可以预测真实光流，确保捕捉真实的运动动态。然后将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上改进了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识，同时保持了对文本提示的遵循，用户研究也证实了改进效果。

Conclusion: 提出的运动中心对齐框架有效提升了文本到视频扩散模型的运动生成质量，使其生成更合理和物理可信的视频。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，它使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLM作为评判者，能够产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本描述中的属性和关系错误，需要更敏感的评估方法。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，指导大型语言模型作为评判者，通过细粒度错误分析来评估详细图像描述的质量。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上比现有指标与人类评分者相关性更强（Spearman ρ提高+0.05），对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并能作为有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT数据集为详细图像描述评估提供了新的标准，揭示了基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时面临的挑战，为VLM进展设定了新的基准任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UniHPR，一个统一的人体姿态表示学习管道，通过新颖的基于奇异值的对比学习损失来对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态融合和生成应用中，人体姿态表示对许多下游任务至关重要，但目前缺乏对不同模态人体姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm，并在Human3.6M数据集上实现9.24mm MPJPE的2D和3D姿态检索误差。

Conclusion: UniHPR能够有效对齐不同模态的人体姿态表示，在人体姿态估计任务中表现出色，并支持跨模态的姿态检索。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在分割不规则形状和模糊边界的脑肿瘤区域时存在挑战，且高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 在3D U-Net模型中集成注意力机制，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富的区域；使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型有效提高了脑肿瘤分割性能，为临床环境中的可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

*Eyad Gad,Mustafa Abou Khatwa,Mustafa A. Elattar,Sahar Selim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net注意力机制模型，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且私密的AI模型具有挑战性。联邦学习虽能保护隐私，但在非独立同分布数据上训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并整合改进的U-Net模型与注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割精度。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到了96%的准确率，有效提升了肿瘤分割精度，同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有巨大潜力，能够平衡隐私保护与模型性能的需求。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流和状态动作轨迹，促进团队战术意识的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步性和自我中心特性，需要从个体视角理解团队战术的涌现。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时专业级CS2比赛录像），提出跨自我中心对比学习（CECL），通过对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队战术情境意识。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL有效提升了智能体从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

metrics. Code and data are available at

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾诊断主要依赖专家手动观察血涂片图像，缺乏专业知识、技能和人工参与可能导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断方法。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并将其分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: 残差注意力网络和XceptionNet在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最好，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现高度支持深度学习驱动方法在自动可靠检测疟疾方面的可行性，同时最小化直接人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强MLLMs对关键视觉信息的关注，从而缓解幻觉问题。该方法模型无关，几乎不增加推理成本。


<details>

Motivation: 现有缓解MLLMs幻觉的方法需要额外训练或引入外部信息，带来额外计算成本。研究发现幻觉与视觉token注意力不足密切相关，冗余视觉token分散了模型注意力。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注。该方法无需训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs和广泛使用的幻觉评估基准上测试，取得了稳健且出色的结果，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，简单有效且无需额外训练，为缓解MLLMs幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，如美学吸引力和整体一致性，但在图像到视频生成任务中，生成的视频时序一致性往往较差。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并使用基于奖励的微调框架对模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调视频生成模型能显著增强时序一致性，且不会降低其他性能。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的指标，能够显著提升视频生成模型的时序一致性，特别适用于图像到视频生成任务。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强自动驾驶感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和渲染技术生成多视角真实视频，显著提升自动驾驶中的极端场景感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期加倍，当基线方法也使用双倍周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角真实视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: Dream4Drive能够以前所未有的灵活性大规模生成多视角极端场景，显著提升自动驾驶中的极端场景感知能力。实验表明该框架能有效提升下游感知模型在各种训练周期下的性能。

Conclusion: Dream4Drive提供了一个有效的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知视频编辑技术增强自动驾驶感知任务，特别是对极端场景的检测能力，同时贡献了大规模3D资产数据集DriveObj3D以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，没有单一方法能有效处理所有动态挑战。

Method: 使用混合专家框架，通过体积感知像素路由器将体积高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现专家输出的自适应融合。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上持续优于最先进方法，并提高了效率。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术引入动态高斯溅射的方法，在保持性能的同时提供了效率优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体二次曲面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点云稀疏性，在BEV空间实现多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和精确速度测量的优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次曲面参数，生成密集深度图；使用深度图将图像特征从透视视图转换到BEV空间，并生成密集伪点云；采用基于pillar的方法处理雷达点云和伪点云，最后在BEV空间进行检测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft基准测试中实现了优越的性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法，有效解决了4D成像雷达点云稀疏性问题，提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Result: 在公开SpotGEO数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了GEO目标检测性能，F1分数达到90.14%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合小波变换和多帧轨迹补全技术，成功解决了GEO空间目标检测中的关键挑战，为复杂背景下的弱目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

Motivation: 解决车联网带宽限制下传统前景中心方法丢弃背景上下文信息的问题，背景信息对感知性能至关重要但传输成本高。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，无需传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法，证明了上下文增强前景共享的有效性。

Conclusion: FadeLead通过将背景上下文封装到前景特征中，在保持传输效率的同时显著提升了协作感知性能，为解决车联网带宽限制提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了单步扩散模型在真实图像超分辨率中的结构失真问题，通过语义边缘引导和混合损失实现了质量与效率的优化平衡。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Motivation: 现有的T2I扩散模型在语义对齐方面表现良好，但在生成提示中指定数量的对象时仍然存在困难。现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为外部评论家，无法利用计数能力更强的检测器模型。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二进制指示器，在推理时使用预训练的T2I模型优化噪声先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（低密度、高密度和多对象场景）均实现了对象计数准确率的显著提升（如在D2D-Small基准上提升13.7%），且图像质量和计算开销几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将非可微检测器的计数能力引入到T2I生成过程中，显著提高了对象计数准确性，同时保持了图像质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various

in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深和海底分类，在浅水环境测绘中实现了协同增益，显著优于传统方法和单任务基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽略了它们之间的相互作用，限制了深度学习方法在浅水环境测绘中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质沿海站点的广泛评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低高达75%；相比最先进的单任务和多任务基线，水深RMSE降低10-30%，海底分类精度提高达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需额外的VAE通路即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将脑活动映射到CLIP的最终语义层，并添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕获视觉细节，但这忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富对象信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统功能层次结构，将来自不同视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号与对应的CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，引入交叉重建策略和新型多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越最先进方法（包括使用VAE管道的方法），同时参数数量减少71.7%，有效平衡语义准确性和细节保真度。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP无需单独VAE管道即可有效捕获视觉细节，在参数效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的开集视觉分割与识别框架，结合EfficientNetB0进行无监督分割和CLIP进行开集识别，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开集视觉分割与识别问题，避免传统方法需要大量标注数据和训练过程的限制，实现更灵活和通用的视觉理解。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取像素特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 利用CLIP的视觉和文本编码器进行跨模态对齐，通过相似度计算实现开集识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC等标准基准测试中，在匈牙利mIoU、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练方法的有效性、灵活性和泛化能力，为开集视觉理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE是一个可变形医学图像配准框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来解决传统深度学习方法忽视正则化的问题，提高配准的鲁棒性和解剖学合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中虽然精度高、计算效率好，但往往忽视了正则化在确保鲁棒性和解剖学合理性中的关键作用。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含防止折叠机制来惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影（如折叠），避免过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE通过自适应正则化策略在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和灵活性平衡，确保了物理上合理的变换。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF是一个保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的下游应用，同时使用敏感性场来保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为强大的3D场景表示工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间中，因为这会严重降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感性场。扰动场在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动来欺骗下游目标模型，敏感性场学习空间变化的敏感性来自适应约束几何扰动。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有广泛适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF成功解决了NeRF知识产权保护问题，在保持渲染质量的同时有效破坏未经授权使用，为3D场景表示模型提供了实用的IP保护方案。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数VLM评估集中在单视角设置，而多摄像头设置已成为机器人平台标准配置。需要研究VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理。

Method: 创建MV-RoboBench基准测试，评估包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种VLM，以及采用CoT启发技术的增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型的性能远低于人类水平，在多视角机器人感知方面面临重大挑战。空间智能与机器人任务执行呈正相关，但单视角空间理解基准的强性能不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供数据和标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的基于脚部位置对齐的方法能有效减少广角摄像头失真影响，显著提高多摄像头系统中的工人追踪精度。

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观感知任务中表现出色，但在主观情感领域如心理分析的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将包含多个实例的绘图分解为语义子图，构建层次表示；分析各层次子图提取心理洞察；引入HTP知识库和特征提取模块生成心理档案；整合多方面信息进行评估。

Conclusion: PICK弥合了MLLMs与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实世界IC缺陷分类中的两个主要问题：数据分布极度偏斜（远超公开不平衡数据集），以及样本同时包含类别特定属性和领域相关特征，增加了分类难度。

Method: 提出ReCAME-Net模型，采用多专家分类器框架，集成区域通道注意力模块、度量学习损失、困难类别挖掘策略和知识蒸馏过程。

Conclusion: ReCAME-Net能有效处理高度不平衡IC缺陷数据，解决了类内多样性大和类间相似性高的双重挑战。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了优异的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197。生成的图像显示出卓越的代表性，双约束误差为1.9-11.3%，而随机提取的真实子图像误差为36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的MRI加速新范式，通过预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，从图像重建转向预测性成像，显著提升了高加速因子下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描时间过长限制了临床效率，传统图像重建方法在高度欠采样下效果有限，需要新的加速方法。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为先验信息，然后基于此先验重建高度欠采样的k空间数据，支持多种数据源作为条件输入。

Result: 在内部和公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描）上验证，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法，包括无先验或替代先验的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN是一个新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过跨序列模式重用和记忆驱动的图卷积来解决深度模糊问题，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理单个序列，未能利用人体运动中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式，限制了姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索并融合解剖约束，采用双流混合架构结合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，展现了增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动领域发展至关重要，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡）导致的表示偏差问题，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中。作者发现模型会将图像覆盖率与标签相关联，导致在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。他们评估了多种插补方法，并提出加权重采样方案来消除这种关联。结果表明这些方法能显著减少表示偏差，同时保持检测性能，并在实际应用中提高了低覆盖率图像中的羽流检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡）会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差。在甲烷羽流检测中，缺失像素数量与标签之间的虚假关联会使模型将图像覆盖率与标签联系起来，导致在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。

Method: 1. 评估多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系；2. 提出加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间内强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 重采样和插补方法都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在实际操作场景中，经过偏差校正的模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的能力更强。

Conclusion: 通过重采样和插补方法可以有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高甲烷羽流检测模型在低覆盖率图像中的性能，为实际应用提供了有效的偏差校正方案。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Motivation: 当前主流方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但由于域偏移和有限域知识，模型容易陷入伪相关的陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1）交叉注意力提示模块，通过视觉提示与交叉注意力结合减轻伪特征偏差；2）双分支适配器，通过高频特征提取实现域适应，同时解耦因果-伪特征。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上，Cauvis相比现有域泛化方法性能提升15.9-31.4%，在复杂干扰环境中展现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关问题，通过因果视觉提示机制显著提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应收敛到峰值能力所需的最小分辨率，训练为离散分类器但在推理时可插值连续分辨率。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了视觉语言模型计算效率低的问题，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: PoseCrafter能够有效增强相机位姿估计，特别是在小重叠或无重叠图像对的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Method: 研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型在计数任务中的推理能力，在受控实验条件下进行层间分析，发现错误源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题，通过仅微调输出层进行针对性训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，并在真实世界数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的计数错误主要源于输出层映射问题，针对性微调输出层能显著提升模型性能，这为改进视觉语言模型的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势，但两者存在显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合

Method: 提出分层非对称蒸馏框架，采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失

Result: 在广泛实验中一致优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了多模态融合中的时空不对称问题，显著提升了目标跟踪性能

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 揭示了视频感知系统中先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗环境中考虑alpha通道防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种设置下的客观指标和主观质量均显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: VGD验证了其可扩展性和高保真环绕视角重建能力。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在多焦点图像融合复杂挑战方面取得了重要进展，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLMs的注意力图直接转换为视频分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现出色，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与物体区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来改进注意力图以实现精确的视频分割。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合(DecAF)方法，包含对比性物体-背景融合和互补性视频帧融合两个机制，通过抑制无关激活和增强物体聚焦线索来精炼注意力图，并结合注意力引导的SAM2提示获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在引用和推理视频目标分割基准测试中优于其他无需训练方法，性能与基于训练的方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无需重新训练MLLMs即可实现高质量视频分割的可行性，为训练自由的视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时间步交叉注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法通常生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 提出条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，生成多个多样化的伪造定位图；引入伯努利噪声以更好反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性；设计时间步交叉注意力(TSCAttention)利用语义特征和时间步指导改进检测。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法，显示出在实际部署中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个可信的伪造定位图，有效解决了伪造区域的不确定性和变异性问题，为图像伪造定位提供了更可靠和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准测试XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中虽然识别能力强，但在可靠定位方面仍不足，特别是在小病灶或弥散性病变上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中展现出强大的零样本性能，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多种病理上的对齐程度。

Result: (1) 所有VLM变体对大型和明确病理的定位表现合理，但对小型或弥散性病变的性能显著下降；(2) 在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型表现出更好的对齐；(3) 模型的整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管具有强大的识别能力，但在临床可靠的定位方面仍有不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的降噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来捕获图像的几何规律性，达到了卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下的渐近极小极大界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中不够丰富，无法适应复杂的信号规律性。对于边缘为分段Cα曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，小波、曲波和Xlet框架都是次优的。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建降噪估计器，证明这些ℓ¹范数捕获了不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Result: 数值实验表明，该降噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了渐近极小极大界。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种不同的调和分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，在调和分析与深度卷积网络降噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上的实验表明，GenComm优于现有最先进方法，集成新智能体时计算成本和参数数量减少81%。

Conclusion: GenComm通过轻量级空间信息数值对齐和特征生成，实现了高效、可扩展的异构多智能体协作感知，显著降低了集成新智能体的成本。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

TL;DR: AMR是一个无需外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架，通过两阶段训练解决数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分不足的问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法的三个关键瓶颈：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、以及细粒度语义区分不足（如区分'踢球'与'扔球'）。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性同时实现现实世界泛化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比先前最先进方法实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架通过零外部依赖的方式有效克服了数据标注不足导致的局部最优问题，显著提升了边界和语义区分能力，并具有良好的现实世界泛化性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: PWM范式成功统一了世界建模和规划，通过类人类的预期感知实现了更可靠的规划性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理过程和强化学习，有效提升了医学视觉语言模型的诊断性能

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动机制，解决了3D高斯溅射中的梯度稀释和基元冻结问题，有效消除了过重建伪影，在保持几何细节的同时实现了最先进的视图合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分割不足，但本文发现了两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出了基于重新激活原理的ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元增长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。该机制在其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）中也带来了一致的改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制成功解决了3D高斯溅射中的基元冻结问题，不仅提升了复杂场景的渲染质量，还展示了在多种3D-GS变体中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in

*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CST框架，在无配对图像翻译中保持细长曲线结构完整性，提升医学图像翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法会扭曲微血管等细长曲线结构，影响医学诊断可靠性和定量分析，特别是在眼科和血管成像中这些细微形态变化具有重要临床意义

Method: CST框架通过集成结构一致性到训练中，添加曲线结构提取模块进行拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法如CycleGAN和UNSB中

Result: 在三种成像模态（OCT血管造影、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影）上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过加强学习映射中的几何完整性，CST为医学成像中曲线结构感知的跨域翻译建立了原则性途径

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，为基于深度学习的活体检测系统提供视觉解释，增强系统透明度和可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解系统判断真假生物特征图像的关键区域

Method: 开发Ensemble-CAM技术，通过视觉解释方法揭示深度学习模型在活体检测中的决策依据

Result: 提供了详细的视觉解释，能够展示系统判断生物特征图像真伪的关键区域

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够有效提升基于深度学习的活体检测系统的透明度和可信度

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，抑制干扰因素并学习稳健的潜在表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰视觉因素。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并使用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和变换器基线中具有最低的分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生不仅准确而且物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，通过自适应权重量化方案解决激活值分布不均匀和权重量化码本不匹配问题，在ImageNet上仅用2.81位平均位宽实现ResNet-18的71.512% Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的高度非均匀分布和权重量化中使用的静态、不匹配码本。

Method: ADQ采用混合精度量化框架，包含三个关键创新：基于分位数的码本初始化、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、以及敏感度指导的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成了硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均位宽达到71.512% Top-1准确率，在可比条件下优于现有最优方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究系统验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应分布感知量化有效解决了量化训练中的关键挑战，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型位宽需求。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多功能多模态人体运动生成框架，采用自回归扩散变换器，支持文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并构建了最大的统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态人体运动生成中内容一致性、风格保持和时间动态控制的问题，以及应对多模态任务之间的冲突，需要一个统一的框架来支持多样化的运动生成任务。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，构建了包含28个MoCap源的统一数据集OmniMoCap-X，并使用GPT-4o自动生成结构化标注。

Result: 实验评估表明，OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够生成逼真、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X通过统一的序列到序列框架和创新的训练策略，成功解决了多模态运动生成中的关键挑战，为交互式长时运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: 提出了CPL-NC框架，通过类感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的测试时适应问题，提升在长尾分布和语义相似类混淆情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练分布与部署分布不一致时性能会下降，现有测试时适应方法忽视了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类之间的混淆问题。

Method: CPL-NC包含类感知原型缓存模块（动态调整每类容量并保留稀有类别知识）和负对比学习机制（约束困难视觉文本负样本），采用非对称优化策略，仅优化文本原型同时锚定稳定的视觉特征。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于先前的测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级的测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，特别是在处理长尾分布和类间混淆问题上表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得了显著进展，但研究社区缺乏基于真实图像的大规模、高质量、开放访问的数据集，这限制了进一步的研究发展。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages集合的真实照片生成多样化的编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保全面覆盖编辑类型，通过MLLM质量评分和精心策划来保持内容保存和指令忠实度。

Result: 创建了包含40万张图像的Pico-Banana-400K数据集，包含三个专门子集：7.2万示例的多轮编辑集合、5.6万示例的偏好子集，以及配对的短长编辑指令集合。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了强大的基础资源，支持复杂编辑场景的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，评估它们对地面真值各种扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动严重不敏感，提出了基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具和创建更好对齐人类判断的复合指标的合理方法。

Conclusion: 现有深度估计评估指标存在严重缺陷，新提出的指标和工具能更好地与人类判断对齐，为深度估计评估提供了更可靠的标准。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

Motivation: 虽然机器翻译在高资源语言上取得了显著进展，但低资源语言如锡尔赫特语仍然研究不足，需要探索有效的翻译方法。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型（如mBART-50和MarianMT），并与零样本大语言模型进行比较实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于大语言模型，mBART-50在翻译充分性方面表现最佳，MarianMT在字符级保真度方面最强。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于零样本方法的机器生成内容检测器（如Fast DetectGPT、GPTZero）存在计算成本高或准确率不足的问题，需要在准确性和效率之间做出权衡。

Method: 使用专门的数据集对预训练的编码器专用小型语言模型（RoBERTa和CodeBERTa）进行微调，用于源代码和自然语言的二元分类任务。

Result: 编码器模型在AUROC达到0.97-0.99，宏F1分数达到0.89-0.94，同时延迟降低8-12倍，峰值VRAM使用减少3-5倍。在跨生成器转移和对抗性变换下，性能保持≥92%的干净AUROC。

Conclusion: 对于二元分类任务，小型语言模型在计算效率和准确率方面都大幅优于大型语言模型，为机器生成内容检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [81] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase是一个模型无关的框架，利用大语言模型在主题建模前将原始推文重述为更标准化的正式语言，显著提升了主题建模在社交媒体短文本分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本（如推文）的简短性、非正式性和噪声阻碍了传统主题建模的有效性，导致产生不连贯或冗余的主题，难以解释。

Method: 开发了TM-Rephrase框架，使用LLMs将原始推文重述为更正式的语言，研究了两种重述策略（通用重述和口语到正式重述）对多种主题建模方法的影响。

Result: TM-Rephrase提高了主题建模的三个性能指标（主题连贯性、主题独特性和主题多样性），同时减少了大多数主题建模算法的主题冗余，其中口语到正式策略效果最佳，尤其对LDA算法提升最大。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共卫生相关社交媒体分析中的主题建模提供了一种模型无关的增强方法，对改善健康危机及其他重要领域中公共话语的理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了ODiS算法，通过PCA将多维度评分解耦为正交特征维度，确保预训练数据在质量和多样性上的平衡选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分数的数据选择方法会压缩相关维度，导致高分数据看似高质量但忽视多样性，造成下游性能下降。

Method: ODiS算法：1）多维度评估数据质量；2）用PCA解耦相关维度；3）训练Roberta评分器进行大规模推理；4）在各正交维度选择高分数据。

Result: ODiS选择的数据维度间重叠率低于2%，验证了正交性；使用该数据训练的模型在下游基准测试中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 正交、多样性感知的数据选择对LLM至关重要，ODiS能有效平衡数据质量和多样性。

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态可逆的剪枝框架，通过检测上下文感知的神经元激活并应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的影响，实现推理时的细粒度偏见缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型内部表示中存在不良行为，影响公平性、一致性，并放大有害内容。现有方法计算成本高、不可逆且难以适应新对话上下文。

Method: 动态可逆剪枝框架，检测上下文感知的神经元激活，应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的神经元影响。

Result: 在单轮和多轮多语言对话中实现了细粒度的、保持知识的偏见缓解，行为更加一致，支持动态公平控制。

Conclusion: 该推理时解决方案为现实对话AI提供了灵活、透明的动态公平控制方法，优于静态剪枝方法。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正从单模态理解向统一视觉、音频和语言模态的全模态模型发展，但单模态与全模态之间的相关性尚不明确，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能进化。

Method: 构建了包含1880个人工标注样本、44种任务类型的基准测试，并引入了创新的多步骤开放性问题类型来更好地评估复杂推理任务。

Result: 实验结果表明跨模态和单模态性能之间存在组合规律，全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，而在强模型上表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench是一个高质量、多样化的全模态基准测试，能够有效评估单模态和全模态理解能力，揭示了全模态能力在不同模型强度下的不同表现模式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

TL;DR: 提出基于transformer预训练语言模型的可解释性假新闻检测流程，通过两阶段微调策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上的虚假信息传播破坏了信任并阻碍了知情决策，需要开发高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 使用两阶段微调策略：先冻结骨干网络训练分类头，然后逐步解冻骨干层并应用分层学习率衰减。集成LIME进行token级解释和SHAP进行全局特征归因。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop数据集上，DistilBERT达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 结合原则性微调和可解释性的预训练语言模型可以为可扩展、可信赖的虚假信息检测提供有效框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络来评估LLM故事生成能力的新方法，发现LLM生成的故事倾向于紧密的积极关系网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂任务中的创造能力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络（带符号边权重的网络），对四个领先LLM生成的1200多个故事进行大规模比较分析。

Result: 基于网络属性（密度、聚类、符号边权重）的分析显示，LLM生成的故事持续表现出对紧密、积极关系的强烈偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM在创意故事讲述中的局限性和倾向提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了SLIM框架，通过分离搜索和浏览工具并定期总结轨迹，解决长轨迹代理搜索中的上下文限制问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理搜索框架在长轨迹任务中面临上下文限制问题，包括积累冗长噪声内容、达到上下文窗口和工具预算限制或过早停止，无法扩展到长轨迹搜索。

Method: 引入SLIM框架，将检索分离为独立的搜索和浏览工具，并定期总结轨迹，保持上下文简洁的同时实现更长、更专注的搜索。

Result: 在长轨迹任务中，SLIM以显著更低的成本和更少的工具调用达到可比性能。使用o3作为基础模型时，在BrowseComp和HLE上分别达到56%和31%，优于所有开源框架，同时工具调用减少4-6倍。

Conclusion: SLIM框架在长轨迹代理搜索中表现出更少的幻觉，作者希望分析框架和简单工具设计能为未来长轨迹代理系统提供参考。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要局限于数学、编程等易于验证的任务，无法评估LLM在处理专业文档和生成综合报告等实际应用中的表现。

Method: 构建ProfBench基准，包含专家评估的响应-标准对；开发经济高效的LLM-Judges评估系统，通过减轻自我增强偏见，将评估成本降低2-3个数量级。

Result: ProfBench对最先进的LLM构成显著挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5-high模型仅达到65.9%的总体性能；发现专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ProfBench为专业领域LLM评估提供了公平可访问的基准，揭示了扩展思维在处理复杂专业任务中的重要作用。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型对良性提示的防御性拒绝问题，以及静态数据集因模型演进而退化的问题。

Method: 开发动态生成模型特定挑战数据集的框架，构建OVERBENCH基准，聚合来自25个模型的45万个样本。

Result: OVERBENCH提供了一个动态演进的视角来监测过度敏感性，能够捕捉静态数据集忽略的漏洞。

Conclusion: 该框架能够持续监测模型防御触发器，随着模型发展而演进，解决了静态数据集的局限性。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在人际互动中的应用增多，需要评估其在社交推理方面的能力，特别是在跨文化语境下。

Method: 构建了包含1000个对话的SCRIPTS数据集，来自电影剧本，标注了说话者之间的人际关系概率标签，评估了9个模型的表现。

Result: 专有LLM在英语数据集上达到75-80%准确率，但在韩语上降至58-69%；模型在10-25%的情况下选择了不可能的关系；思维链提示对社会推理帮助有限且可能放大社会偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的社会推理能力存在显著局限，需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在生物医学术语标准化任务中的表现，发现微调效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度，基因标识符表现最佳，而GO和HPO术语由于标识符任意性导致泛化能力有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集成依赖术语标准化，需要将自然语言术语映射到标准化标识符。大语言模型在此任务中表现不均，需要评估其在不同生物医学本体中的记忆和泛化能力

Method: 微调Llama 3.1 8B模型，在多个生物医学本体（GO、HPO、GENE）上评估记忆能力（训练术语性能）和泛化能力（验证术语性能），并进行嵌入分析

Result: GO术语显示强记忆增益（准确率提升77%），HPO改进最小；仅基因映射实现泛化（13.9%增益）；GPT-4o在所有术语中表现最佳；基因符号与蛋白质名称语义对齐紧密，GO和HPO对齐弱

Conclusion: 微调成功取决于标识符流行度和词汇化程度：流行标识符增强记忆，词汇化标识符（如基因符号）支持语义泛化，而任意标识符（GO、HPO）限制模型为机械学习

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在参数知识与提示中冲突信息存在差异时的行为，提出领域无关的知识冲突框架和代码冲突评估方法，发现大模型能编码知识冲突概念，并通过激活引导提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展知识冲突研究到代码生成领域，探究LLMs如何处理参数知识与提示信息之间的冲突，开发通用框架来构建和解释此类冲突。

Method: 提出领域无关的知识冲突构建框架，开发针对代码冲突场景的新评估方法和数据集，使用激活级引导技术进行实验。

Result: 大型LLMs能在参数中编码知识冲突概念，知识冲突检测准确率达80.65%；激活引导相比随机基线提升12.6%的成功率，但效果取决于模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs能够识别知识冲突，激活引导是有效的干预方法，但需要仔细平衡模型规模、任务特性和引导策略才能获得最佳效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于谱分析的框架，将Transformer层建模为由注意力诱导的动态图，通过图信号处理定义诊断指标，用于检测大语言模型中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在事实推理和幻觉区分方面存在挑战，需要开发新的分析框架来理解模型内部表示和错误行为。

Method: 将Transformer层建模为动态图，token嵌入作为图上的信号，通过图信号处理定义Dirichlet能量、谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标。

Result: 实验发现事实陈述呈现一致的"能量山"行为，而不同类型的幻觉显示不同特征：逻辑矛盾导致谱不稳定，语义错误保持稳定但连接性漂移，替换幻觉显示中等扰动。基于谱特征的检测器达到88.75%准确率。

Conclusion: 谱几何可能捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为检测大语言模型中的幻觉提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

TL;DR: 通过图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，研究发现不同transformer架构通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，产生可检测的"计算指纹"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，并开发一种无需训练的诊断方法来揭示架构偏见。

Method: 使用图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，跟踪20种语言和三种模型家族在语态转换下代数连通性（Fiedler值）的变化，重点关注早期层（2-5层）。

Result: 发现清晰的架构特征：Phi-3-Mini在英语中显示显著的早期层中断，而其他19种语言影响最小；Qwen2.5-7B显示对形态丰富语言的小幅分布式偏移；LLaMA-3.2-1B显示系统但温和的响应。这些光谱特征与行为差异强相关。

Conclusion: 训练重点可以在计算中留下可检测的印记，表现为在句法转换期间可测量的连接模式。该框架可作为简单、无需训练的诊断工具，用于揭示架构偏见和支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，科技公司面临大量软件工程师需求，需要高效筛选候选人。鉴于LLMs在编码和推理任务中的表现，研究其能否通过标准化招聘评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用最先进的LLMs对广泛使用的专业评估问卷生成回答，然后将模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案进行比较评估。

Result: 所有评估的LLMs都无法通过招聘评估，模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案存在显著不一致。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在编码和推理任务中表现出色，但它们目前无法通过科技公司的标准化招聘评估，不能被视为理想的工程师候选人。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的迭代提示方法在多跳检索增强生成中效率低下，存在令牌重复生成和随机停止的问题。

Method: 提出TSSS框架，包含模板化推理（缓存重复前缀、锚定子查询）和检索器终止器（确定性地停止推理）。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上达到最先进准确率，在RAG-CoT方法中具有竞争力效率。

Conclusion: TSSS在效率受限场景（如设备端推理）中表现出色，实现了快速推理和可靠答案。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

TL;DR: 提出evolveQA基准测试，专门评估LLM处理时态知识冲突的能力，基于三个真实世界的时间戳语料库构建，展示LLM在动态知识问题上的性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过基于结构化知识库的基准测试评估时态知识冲突，但存在关注流行实体、缺乏动态结构等问题，无法公平评估不同知识截止日期的LLM。

Method: 从AWS更新、Azure变更和WHO疾病爆发报告三个真实时间戳语料库中识别自然发生的知识演化，生成针对不同LLM知识截止日期的问题和黄金答案。

Result: 通过对12个开源和闭源LLM在3种知识探测格式上的广泛评估，evolveQA相比静态知识问题性能下降高达31%。

Conclusion: evolveQA基准测试有效揭示了LLM在时态知识演化方面的局限性，为评估LLM处理动态知识能力提供了专门工具。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Motivation: 开发不依赖检索增强生成(RAG)和大语言模型(LLM)的问答系统，探索基于纯知识图谱检索的替代方案。

Method: 两阶段流程：1)预处理文档生成问答对；2)将问答对转换为知识图谱，使用嵌入和模糊技术进行图检索，通过查询、重排序和复述生成最终答案。

Result: 在CRAG基准测试中使用LLM-as-a-judge评估，LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到71.9%和54.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 证明了不依赖LLM-RAG的纯知识图谱检索问答系统的可行性，为轻量级问答系统提供了替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Motivation: 现有评估方法要么关注用户满意度，要么关注工具调用能力，但无法捕捉多轮工具增强对话中的关键错误，比如代理误解工具结果却仍让用户满意的情况。

Method: 引入TRACE基准（系统合成的工具增强对话数据集）和SCOPE评估框架（自动发现多样化错误模式和评估标准）。

Result: 实验表明SCOPE显著优于基线方法，特别是在用户满意度信号具有误导性的挑战性案例上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决工具增强对话系统的复杂错误评估提供了有效的基准和框架，能够识别传统方法难以发现的深层问题。

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

TL;DR: DiSRouter提出了一种分布式自我路由范式，通过LLM代理的自我认知能力来决定是否回答问题或路由到其他代理，相比集中式路由系统具有更好的灵活性、可扩展性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于集中式外部路由器的系统存在灵活性差、性能不佳的问题，因为小型路由器无法充分理解不同LLM的知识边界。需要一种更有效的查询路由方法来平衡性能和成本。

Method: 采用分布式路由设计，查询在网络中的LLM代理间传递，每个代理基于自我认知独立决定是否回答或路由。提出两阶段自我认知训练流程来增强LLM的自我意识。

Result: 实验表明DiSRouter在各种场景下的效用显著优于现有路由方法，能有效区分简单和困难查询，并在领域外任务上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM内在的自我认知比外部评估更有效，为更模块化和高效的多智能体系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言知识库（如URIEL+）存在两个关键限制：一刀切的向量表示不适合语言数据的多样结构，缺乏将这些信号聚合成单一综合分数的原则性方法。

Method: 为每种距离类型提出新颖的结构感知表示：地理学使用说话者加权分布，谱系学使用双曲嵌入，类型学使用潜变量模型，并将这些信号统一为任务无关的复合距离。

Result: 在跨语言迁移的语言选择中，所提出的表示和复合距离在广泛的NLP任务中持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更原则性和有效的工具包，改进了现有语言距离表示方法。

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

Conclusion: SheetBrain通过神经符号双工作流框架有效解决了LLMs在复杂表格推理中的挑战，为表格数据处理提供了准确可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

Motivation: 当前通用代理主要依赖网页浏览器与环境交互，而MCP协议带来了大量任务特定工具集，需要评估工具调用代理在实际服务交互中的表现。

Method: 使用真实世界服务的REST API创建MCP服务器，提供手动标注的真实工具，通过完美工具检索和实际工具检索两种方式评估代理性能。

Result: 所有模型使用工具检索时表现相似或优于基于浏览器的代理，但小模型无法充分利用可用工具，GPT-5的工具检索性能接近其使用真实工具的性能。

Conclusion: 当前模型在导航数万工具并以非平凡方式组合解决复杂问题方面仍面临挑战，需要更好的推理和检索模型。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: KORE是一种协同方法，通过知识导向的增强和约束，在大型多模态模型中注入新知识的同时保留旧知识，解决了知识适应和知识保留的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型的预训练知识是静态的，无法跟上现实世界的发展，这阻碍了持续知识获取。现有方法在学习新知识时往往存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: KORE自动将单个知识项转换为结构化和全面的知识，确保模型准确学习新知识；同时将先前知识存储在LMM线性层激活的协方差矩阵中，通过将原始权重投影到矩阵的零空间来初始化适配器，定义最小化与先前知识干扰的微调方向。

Result: 在多种LMM（包括LLaVA-v1.5-7B、LLaVA-v1.5-13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B）上的广泛实验表明，KORE实现了优越的新知识注入性能，并有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: KORE通过知识导向的增强和约束，成功解决了大型多模态模型的知识注入和保留问题，在知识适应和知识保留方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含11个类别的幻觉综合分类法，并开发了HAD模型，将幻觉检测、跨度级识别和纠正集成到单一推理过程中。模型在约90K合成数据集上训练，在多个测试集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成模型的广泛应用，模型产生看似合理但错误信息的幻觉问题日益突出，幻觉检测成为关键任务。

Method: 提出综合幻觉分类法，开发HAD模型集成检测、识别和纠正功能，使用约90K合成样本训练，并构建包含2,248样本的HADTest测试集。

Result: 在领域内和领域外测试集上，HAD模型普遍优于现有基线，在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench上达到最先进结果，证实了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: HAD模型通过集成检测、识别和纠正功能，在多个NLG任务中表现出色，为幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超体积优化的多目标强化学习策略HVO，用于优化文本摘要的多个目标（一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性），在多个数据集上表现优于GRPO方法，7B模型增强后性能接近GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本摘要需要同时优化多个目标，但现有基于LLM的强化学习方法很少关注多目标优化问题。

Method: 使用超体积方法在RL奖励过程中动态调整组间分数，引导模型逐步逼近帕累托前沿，生成多目标平衡的摘要。

Result: 在多个代表性摘要数据集上，HVO方法在总体得分上优于GRPO，在不同维度上表现更均衡；7B基础模型增强后性能与GPT-4相当，且生成长度更短。

Conclusion: HVO是一种有效的多目标优化策略，能够生成平衡多个目标的优质摘要，在保持较短生成长度的同时达到与大型模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

TL;DR: 将推理能力集成到语音大语言模型中用于端到端槽位填充任务，通过思维链框架分解任务步骤，创建推理数据集并进行监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理大语言模型最新发展的启发，希望将推理能力引入语音大语言模型，以提升槽位填充任务的性能。

Method: 使用思维链框架将槽位填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，创建推理数据集，对语音大语言模型进行监督微调，区分常规和推理语音大语言模型，并实验不同类型的文本基础模型。

Result: 引入推理步骤能提升性能，但主要用于数学、逻辑和编码领域的推理文本大语言模型作为基础模型可能表现较差。混合语音大语言模型（基于混合文本基础模型并同时保留直接和推理操作模式）性能优于仅使用单一操作模式的模型。

Conclusion: 推理步骤能有效提升语音大语言模型在槽位填充任务中的性能，但基础模型的选择很重要，混合操作模式的模型表现最佳。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Motivation: 将心理学中群体身份认同的见解与先进NLP技术结合，探索将社会人口属性融入LLMs是否能解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用两种身份提示方法：浅层身份提示和基于检索增强生成（RAG）的深度情境化身份开发，以纳入更丰富的身份特征。

Result: 分析了使用组内和组外标注者身份对模型检测性能和公平性的影响，展示了身份基础方法在减少偏见方面的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 将社会人口属性融入LLMs可以解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见，身份基础方法为开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: LOGICAL是一个基于微调GLiNER模型的本地化PII去除系统，在临床笔记中高效去除个人身份信息，性能优于大型语言模型，适合资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床笔记PII去除中计算成本高和数据隐私风险的问题，特别是在低资源环境中。

Method: 使用1515份临床文档，定义9个PII类别，微调GLiNER模型，并与Azure NER、Presidio、Gemini-Pro-2.5和Llama-3.3-70B进行比较。

Result: 微调GLiNER模型达到0.980的F1分数，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5（0.845），95%的文档完全净化，可在标准笔记本上运行。

Conclusion: 微调的专业化transformer模型如GLiNER为临床笔记PII去除提供了准确、计算高效且安全的解决方案，是资源密集型LLMs的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 该论文通过扩展DnD Gesture语料库，引入2,663个语义手势标注，使用混合专家框架整合文本、音频和手势来预测对话中的话轮转换，结果显示语义手势能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类对话中多模态线索（如语音、手势、注视）对话轮转换的作用，特别是手势作为补充线索的重要性。

Method: 扩展DnD Gesture语料库为DnD Gesture++，包含2,663个语义手势标注；使用混合专家框架整合文本、音频和手势特征进行话轮转换预测。

Result: 实验表明，加入语义引导的手势特征相比基线模型能带来持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 语义手势在多模态话轮转换中发挥补充作用，证明了手势线索的重要性。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准，用于评估多说话人多轮对话的语音理解能力，特别关注说话人归属推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在语音和文本理解方面表现良好，但在自然对话中理解谁在什么时候说了什么（说话人归属推理）方面仍存在困难。

Method: 基于四个开放语料库构建了包含12,000多个验证实例的数据集，包含音频、转录文本和元数据，设计了说话人归属问答和说话人归属匹配两个任务。

Result: 模型能够捕捉说了什么内容，但经常无法识别是谁说的，揭示了说话人感知对话理解的关键差距。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个具有挑战性的基准，将推动说话人感知多模态理解的研究进展。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: AgenticMath是一个用于生成高质量数学问答对的智能代理流程，通过四阶段方法提升LLM的数学推理能力，使用少量高质量数据即可达到或超越使用大量低质量数据的基线模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在创建高质量数据集以改进LLM推理方面存在挑战，常常生成低质量/错误答案，且从可用数据源中获取的信息丰富度有限。

Method: 四阶段流程：1)种子问题筛选器选择信息丰富、复杂且清晰的问题；2)多代理系统生成多样化、逻辑一致的改写问题；3)使用思维链推理重写答案以增强数值和逻辑正确性；4)最终问答评估保留最优对。

Result: 在3B-8B参数LLM上使用AgenticMath生成的数据集（仅30-60K数学样本）进行微调，在多样化的领域内和领域外数学推理基准测试中，相比使用更多数据（如400K或2.3M样本）的基线模型，实现了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 定向、高质量的数据生成是改进LLM数学推理的更有效途径，优于大规模、低质量的替代方案。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL是一种数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain技术将短多跳QA转化为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型在16K长度下有效解决128K任务，显著提升长上下文推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理对大型语言模型至关重要，但现有强化学习方法主要针对短上下文，缺乏对长上下文高级推理模式的探索，且高难度强化学习数据稀缺。

Method: 提出KeyChain方法，通过插入UUID链将短多跳QA转化为长上下文任务，要求模型逐步追踪正确链、识别真实问题、检索相关事实并进行推理。使用强化学习训练该数据。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B和14B上，LoongRL将长上下文多跳QA准确率分别提升23.5%和21.1%。LoongRL-14B达到74.2分，媲美更大前沿模型。同时提升长上下文检索能力，通过所有128K压力测试，并保持短上下文推理能力。

Conclusion: LoongRL通过数据驱动的强化学习方法，成功诱导出计划-检索-推理-复查的推理模式，在有限训练长度下实现长上下文推理能力的显著提升和泛化。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过将传统MoE模型中的单体专家分解为细粒度子专家，并配合在线调度引擎，实现了弹性AI服务，解决了MoE模型在成本与质量间的刚性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型依赖top-k路由机制，只能在少数粗粒度操作点间切换，导致成本与质量间的困难权衡，无法适应多样化的服务水平目标，造成资源过度配置。

Method: 1. 离线重构引擎：使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器将单体专家分解为细粒度子专家，保持功能局部性且无需重新训练；2. 在线调度引擎：实施QoS感知调度策略，解决云部署中的吞吐量最大化问题和内存受限设备的延迟优化卸载问题。

Result: 在三个不同MoE模型上的评估显示，MoE-Prism提供了比基线多4倍以上的稳定操作点，在严格延迟预算下可将吞吐量提升19.9%，在有限资源下可将延迟降低10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"来弥合模型与系统间的差距，实现了下一代自适应、高效且QoS感知的AI服务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

Motivation: 传统手语翻译系统依赖手语注释，但这类数据通常规模有限且标注标准不一。本文旨在开发不依赖手语注释的翻译方法。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为训练时的监督信号，这种方法不需要手动标注，而是从原始文本数据中学习。支持多语言设置，实验了单语和多语句子嵌入及翻译系统。

Result: 在德语(PHOENIX-2014T)和美国手语(How2Sign)数据集上显著优于其他无手语注释的方法，在没有额外预训练数据的情况下缩小了与依赖手语注释系统的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为无手语注释的手语翻译设立了新的最先进水平，有效解决了手语注释数据稀缺和标准不一的问题。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Shakib Yazdani,Cennet Oguz,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用语言无关的多模态嵌入监督手语翻译，结合多语言目标增强和视频扰动，提升模型鲁棒性和跨语言泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译通常使用单一语言的文本监督，限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。现有方法虽然用文本句子嵌入替代了gloss监督，但仍受限于特定语言和模态。

Method: 采用在多种语言文本和语音上训练的语言无关多模态嵌入来监督SLT，实现直接多语言翻译。提出耦合增强方法，结合多语言目标增强（翻译成多种语言）和视频级扰动，提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示相比仅使用文本句子嵌入监督，在BLEURT指标上获得一致提升，在低资源设置下改进更大。

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督结合耦合增强，为传统SLT训练提供了可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR是一个轻量级模型（<30万参数），通过探测早期LLM层实现实体提及检测，在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上精确度，证明了结构化实体表示存在于早期transformer层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息提取的基础，但也是性能瓶颈。研究旨在探索是否可以从早期LLM层中高效恢复结构化实体表示。

Method: 开发ToMMeR模型，通过探测早期LLM层来检测实体提及，使用轻量级架构（<300K参数），并扩展了span分类头。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中实现93%零样本召回率，90%以上精确度；跨模型分析显示不同架构（14M-15B参数）在提及边界上高度一致（DICE>75%）；扩展span分类头后达到接近SOTA的NER性能（80-87% F1）。

Conclusion: 实体提及检测自然从语言建模中涌现，结构化实体表示存在于早期transformer层，可以用最少的参数高效恢复。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT团队在WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译任务中提出了一个端到端架构，从瑞士德语手语视频直接翻译为德语文本，但测试集性能远低于开发集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译系统通常使用通用seq2seq架构，但缺乏对时间特征的充分利用，需要改进以更好地泛化到新数据集。

Method: 开发了一个学习时空特征表示和翻译的单一模型，实现真正的端到端架构。

Result: 在开发集上达到5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 虽然端到端架构在开发集上表现良好，但在测试集上泛化能力不足，表明需要进一步改进模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0是一个评估认知启发模型的基准，通过选择性容忍度测试模型是否能区分自然学习者错误与人工错误，验证不同训练目标对模型与人类语言习得模式对齐的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合性能导向基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，提供更符合人类语言习得模式的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含136,867个控制三元组（正确、学习者、人工错误）的基准，测试模型对自然学习者错误与匹配人工错误的容忍度差异。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度与标准语法性是不同能力，模型表现按训练范式显著聚类，验证了BLiSS作为评估工具的有效性。

Conclusion: BLiSS是衡量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统模式对齐的稳健工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MINED是一个评估大型多模态模型时间感知能力的基准测试，包含6个关键维度和11个任务，基于维基百科构建了2104个时间敏感知识样本。评估显示Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳，而大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力，且知识编辑方法可以有效更新LMMs的时间敏感知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试设计静态，无法充分评估大型多模态模型对时间敏感知识的理解能力，因此需要构建一个全面的时间感知评估基准。

Method: 从维基百科构建MINED基准测试，包含2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖6种知识类型，由两名专业标注者完成。评估了15个广泛使用的LMMs，并研究了通过知识编辑方法更新时间敏感知识的可行性。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro获得最高平均CEM分数63.07，大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力。LMMs在组织知识上表现最佳，在体育知识上表现最弱。知识编辑方法在单次编辑场景中能有效更新LMMs的时间敏感知识。

Conclusion: MINED基准测试揭示了LMMs在时间敏感知识理解方面的局限性，同时证明了知识编辑方法在更新LMMs时间知识方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek是一个从公开屏幕录制视频自动挖掘训练数据的可扩展管道，无需人工标注，显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练计算机使用代理需要大量GUI交互数据，但人工标注成本过高，需要找到自动获取训练数据的替代方案。

Method: 开发了Video2Action逆向动力学模块，包含视频定位模型和动作内容识别器，从YouTube教程视频中自动提取交互步骤。

Result: 从39,000个YouTube视频中自动生成152万个交互步骤，在OSWorld-Verified上任务成功率从9.3%提升至15.8%，在AgentNetBench上步骤准确率从64.1%提升至69.3%。

Conclusion: 被动互联网视频可以转化为高质量的训练数据，为计算机使用代理提供可扩展的监督学习替代方案。

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

TL;DR: MBR解码在语音转文本任务中优于波束搜索，在自动语音识别和语音翻译任务中表现更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于MBR解码在文本到文本生成任务中有效，期望其在语音到文本任务中也能有效

Method: 使用Whisper及其衍生模型在英语和日语上评估MBR解码用于ASR和ST任务

Result: 在大多数实验设置中，MBR解码的准确性优于波束搜索

Conclusion: MBR解码是需要高准确性的离线ASR和ST任务的有前景方法

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了成员推理攻击和机器生成文本检测之间的可转移性，证明了两个任务的最优度量相同，并通过大规模实验验证了跨任务性能的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然成员推理攻击和机器生成文本检测目标不同，但方法都基于语言模型的概率分布信号，这两个任务被独立研究可能导致忽略对方领域的重要方法。

Method: 从理论上证明两个任务的最优度量相同，并通过大规模实验（7种MIA方法和5种机器文本检测器，涵盖13个领域和10个生成器）验证跨任务性能相关性。

Result: 发现跨任务性能存在强秩相关性（rho > 0.6），Binoculars方法在MIA基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了可转移性的实际影响。

Conclusion: 两个研究社区需要加强跨任务意识和合作，为此开发了MINT统一评估套件，包含15种最新方法的实现。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了在BabyLM预训练中序列长度的影响，发现在固定计算预算下，不同任务和架构的最优序列长度不同：语法泛化任务需要较短序列，而形态类比推理任务需要较长上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型通常使用固定长度的上下文窗口，但在BabyLM挑战赛中许多提交使用更短的序列长度。本文旨在确定BabyLM训练时应使用的最佳序列长度。

Method: 使用100M词的训练数据和固定计算预算，比较了125M参数的Mamba和OPT模型在不同序列长度下的表现。

Result: 虽然较长的序列通常更好，但最优长度取决于任务和架构：语法泛化任务使用较短序列即可，而形态类比推理任务需要较长上下文。

Conclusion: 在BabyLM预训练中，序列长度的选择应根据具体任务和模型架构来决定，没有统一的最优长度。不同任务对上下文长度的需求不同。

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead路由框架，通过预测潜在输出来指导模型选择，在七个基准测试中平均性能提升7.7%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法仅基于输入查询进行分类，忽略了潜在输出信息，无法捕捉隐含意图和上下文细微差别，导致复杂或模糊查询的路由决策不理想

Method: Lookahead路由框架通过预测模型输出的潜在表示来"预见"可能的输出，使用这些预测指导模型选择，实现无需完整推理的知情路由。实现了基于因果和掩码语言模型的两种方法

Result: 在七个公共基准测试（指令遵循、数学推理和代码生成）上的实证评估显示，Lookahead始终优于现有路由基线，相比最先进方法平均性能提升7.7%

Conclusion: Lookahead框架通过预见潜在输出改进了LLM路由决策，在多个任务上实现了显著性能提升，为异构LLM系统提供了更有效的路由解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音基础模型在不同任务上表现出色，但评估方法分散且不统一，不同模型在不同语音处理方面有优势，需要不同的评估协议。

Method: 提出包含三个正交轴的统一分类法：评估方面（测量内容）、模型能力（完成任务所需能力）、任务要求（执行任务所需协议），对现有评估和基准进行分类。

Result: 分类法系统地对现有评估方法进行了映射，揭示了系统性空白（如韵律、交互、推理方面的覆盖不足），为未来基准设计指明了优先方向。

Conclusion: 这项工作为语音模型评估的选择、解释和扩展提供了概念基础和实践指南，有助于更系统地评估不同语音基础模型。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于字体风格的攻击方法SAD，利用人类与NLP模型对风格化文本的感知差异，通过在文本中插入风格化字体和表情符号来欺骗模型，同时保持人类可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体发展，用户使用风格化字体和表情符号表达个性，但这些字符在NLP模型中被处理为不同token，造成人类与模型感知差异，从而引入安全漏洞。

Method: 设计了两种SAD攻击版本：轻量版注重查询效率，强力版追求更好的攻击性能。通过插入风格化字体和表情符号来干扰模型处理。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务上，对传统模型、大语言模型和商业服务进行实验，证明了SAD具有强大的攻击性能。同时展示了SAD对多模态任务（文本到图像、文本到语音生成）的潜在威胁。

Conclusion: 风格化文本在人类可读性和模型处理之间存在感知差异，这为对抗攻击提供了新的攻击面，SAD方法能够有效利用这一差异进行攻击。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

*Danni Liu,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实证研究发现，在多语言微调中，模型与数据规模的相对大小是导致灾难性遗忘的主要因素，指令跟随能力比架构更重要，参数高效微调相比全参数微调没有明显优势，而跨语言对齐可以缓解遗忘并促进正向迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言基础模型在特定语言上微调时经常出现灾难性遗忘，降低在未见语言上的性能。虽然这一现象被广泛记录，但文献对遗忘何时发生存在碎片化结果，需要系统研究来澄清这种模糊性。

Method: 使用机器翻译作为测试平台，在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法上进行受控实验，系统研究多语言微调中触发灾难性遗忘的条件。

Result: 发现模型与数据规模的相对大小是遗忘的主要决定因素；模型的指令跟随能力对保留多语言知识比架构更重要；参数高效微调相比全参数微调在缓解遗忘方面没有明显优势；跨语言对齐可以缓解遗忘并促进对未见目标语言的正向迁移。

Conclusion: 多语言微调中的灾难性遗忘主要由模型与数据规模的相对关系决定，指令跟随能力是关键因素，跨语言对齐是有效的缓解策略，而参数高效微调并非解决遗忘问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

TL;DR: 提出了PBBQ基准数据集，用于评估波斯语大语言模型中的社会偏见，包含16个文化类别和37,000多个问题，发现当前模型存在显著的文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保其与社会规范对齐变得至关重要。现有研究缺乏针对波斯文化背景的社会偏见检测资源。

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，让250名不同人口统计学背景的个体填写问卷，开发了包含16个文化类别的PBBQ基准数据集，并对多个开源和闭源模型进行评测。

Result: 发现当前LLMs在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见，且模型输出往往复制人类偏见模式，反映了学习表征与文化刻板印象之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: PBBQ数据集为波斯语语言模型的偏见评估和缓解提供了基础，论文接受后将公开该数据集供未来研究使用。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展、可解释的众包流程，用于跨语言新闻相似性评估，并创建了CrossNews-UA数据集，包含乌克兰语与波兰语、俄语、英语的新闻对，标注了基于4W标准的语义相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交媒体和错误信息快速传播的时代，跨语言假新闻检测面临挑战。现有跨语言新闻分析数据集由记者和专家手动整理，限制了可扩展性和对新语言的适应性。

Method: 开发了可扩展、可解释的众包流程来收集跨语言新闻相似性数据，创建了CrossNews-UA数据集，包含乌克兰语与相关语言（波兰语、俄语、英语）的新闻对，使用4W标准（何人、何事、何地、何时）进行语义相似性标注和详细解释。

Result: 测试了从传统词袋模型、基于Transformer的架构到大型语言模型（LLMs）的一系列模型，结果突显了多语言新闻分析的挑战，并提供了模型性能的见解。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了跨语言新闻分析数据集的空白，提出了可扩展的数据收集方法，为多语言新闻验证和假新闻检测提供了有价值的资源和见解。

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Kerem Oktar,Theodore R. Sumers,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型是否具备动机警觉能力，即能否像人类一样考虑信息源的动机来评估内容可信度。研究发现LLMs在受控实验中表现良好，但在真实广告场景中表现不佳，需要通过干预措施提升其动机敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在沟通时会考虑信息源的动机来决定是否信任内容，但LLMs在处理信息时是否具备这种动机警觉能力尚不明确。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效运作，它们必须能够批判性地评估内容，考虑信息源的动机。

Method: 首先使用认知科学中的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否与理性模型一致，然后扩展到更自然的在线广告场景。通过简单的干预措施增强意图和动机的显著性。

Result: 在受控实验中，LLMs成功以类似人类的方式折扣来自偏见源的信息；但在在线广告场景中，LLMs的推理与理性模型预测不符，部分原因是额外信息分散了注意力。干预措施显著提高了LLMs与理性模型的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要推广到新的现实世界场景，还需要对这些模型进行进一步改进。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

TL;DR: 本文通过实验研究发现，提示词虽然会影响语言模型内部表示的质量，但这种变化与提示词对目标任务的相关性并不一致相关，挑战了"更相关的提示词必然产生更好表示"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究提示词与语言模型内部表示质量的关系，以揭示预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决，理解语言模型在零样本设置下执行多样化任务的机制。

Method: 进行一系列探测实验，分析不同提示模板组合在零样本分类任务中的嵌入表示，研究提示词对表示质量的影响。

Result: 发现提示词会影响表示质量，但这种变化与提示词对目标任务的相关性并不一致相关，挑战了相关提示词必然产生更好表示的假设。

Conclusion: 提示词与表示质量的关系比预期更复杂，需要进一步分析影响这种意外行为的潜在因素。

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LlavaCode框架通过将代码压缩成紧凑的语义表示，在保持代码生成质量的同时显著减少检索上下文长度，实现20-38%的TTFT降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成在代码补全中效果显著，但引入上下文会延长序列长度导致推理变慢，这在IDE等交互场景中是个关键限制。

Method: 使用小型投影器模块将代码压缩成可由代码LLM解释的紧凑语义表示，将检索上下文减少到仅几个压缩的单令牌向量。

Result: 实验显示压缩上下文在线补全任务中比完整RAG流水线减少20-38%的首令牌时间(TTFT)，同时以可忽略的延迟增加显著提升EM和ES指标。

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架通过上下文压缩有效解决了RAG在代码补全中的延迟问题，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升推理速度。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SmartSwitch推理框架解决LLM在长链思维中的"浅思"问题，通过监控推理过程、检测过早放弃的高潜力思路，并引导模型深入探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维能力是LLM在复杂推理任务中取得突破的关键，但存在"浅思"问题，即模型频繁切换思路而缺乏充分探索，限制了性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块。感知模块使用现成的过程奖励模型识别思路切换点并评估前一个思路的潜力；干预模块在发现高潜力思路被过早放弃时，回溯到切换点前并插入"深化提示"来鼓励深入探索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同规模的各种大型语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的即插即用推理策略，能够有效解决LLM在长链思维中的浅思问题，提升推理深度和性能。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过选择性过滤难以拟合的token，提高推测解码中草稿模型与目标模型的对齐度，从而提升token接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在所有token上最小化KL散度，与推测解码最大化token接受率的目标不一致，导致草稿模型因容量限制无法充分吸收目标模型知识，性能不佳。

Method: AdaSPEC引入选择性token过滤机制，使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的token，专注于在简单token上蒸馏草稿模型，使其更好地与目标模型对齐。

Result: 在算术推理、指令跟随、编程和摘要等多样化任务上，AdaSPEC在31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置下均优于最先进的DistillSpec方法，接受率提升高达15%。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性token过滤改进了知识蒸馏过程，在不影响生成质量的前提下显著提高了推测解码的token接受率。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

TL;DR: 提出DiffAdapt框架，通过分析推理轨迹的熵模式来识别不同难度问题，为每个问题选择最优推理策略，在保持准确率的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理大语言模型虽然能力强，但会生成冗长的思维轨迹，计算效率低下。研究发现模型在简单问题上存在"过度思考"现象，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 基于推理轨迹熵的U型模式分析，开发DiffAdapt框架：使用轻量级探针分类模型隐藏状态，为不同难度问题分配特定提示、温度和最大标记长度的推理策略。

Result: 在5个模型和8个基准测试中，DiffAdapt在保持或提升准确率的同时，将标记使用量减少高达22.4%。

Conclusion: DiffAdapt提供了一种无需微调基础模型即可实现计算高效推理的实用方法，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法面临"学习悬崖"现象：当问题远超模型当前能力时，模型持续失败产生零奖励信号，导致优势计算为零，使困难问题对学习梯度不可见，阻碍进展。

Method: 提出Scaf-GRPO（脚手架分组相对策略优化）框架，首先诊断学习停滞，然后通过注入分层提示（从抽象概念到具体步骤）进行干预，使模型能够自行构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在挑战性数学基准测试中，Scaf-GRPO将Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型在AIME24基准上的pass@1分数相对于普通GRPO基线相对提升了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁模型解决先前无法处理问题的能力提供了稳健有效的方法论，是扩展LLM自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: CoSense-LLM是一个边缘优先框架，将多模态传感器数据转换为紧凑的语义令牌，并与大语言模型协调，在延迟、能耗、带宽和隐私约束下工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在干扰环境中部署大模型时的语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟等共同目标的问题。

Method: 包含四个组件：SenseFusion轻量编码器、Edge-RAG本地检索层、PromptRouter成本感知策略和Secure Execution安全执行路径。

Result: 在家庭、办公室和诊所部署中，实现亚秒级延迟，减少带宽成本，提高事实一致性，并通过本地检索保护隐私。

Conclusion: 支持边缘优先设计，将语义、隐私和可预测延迟视为大模型部署在干扰环境中的同等重要目标。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟虽然提供开放的法律信息资源，但这些复杂制度文本对普通民众来说难以理解和应用，存在法律信息可及性的挑战。

Method: 构建包含880个对话轮次的EUDial数据集，并提出LexGuide框架，利用检索增强生成和分层主题组织来结构化对话进程。

Result: 结果表明，主动的结构化导航缩小了法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的差距。

Conclusion: EUDial和LexGuide为推进主动法律对话系统提供了实用资源。

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 提出Zhyper框架，通过参数高效的因子化超网络从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，用于大语言模型的文化对齐，相比现有方法减少26倍参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法确保LLM按照特定文化规范生成内容，直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用因子化超网络框架，从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，实现参数高效的模型条件化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到竞争性性能，参数减少26倍，在文化对齐任务中展现出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper框架提供了一种参数高效的方法来实现LLM的文化对齐，在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过模型合并来适应代码混合NLP任务的方法，相比传统微调方法在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语的情感分析和仇恨言论检测任务上取得了2-5个F1分数的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型合并作为代码混合NLP传统适应策略的实用替代方案，旨在更有效地利用未标记的代码混合数据。

Method: 从多语言基础模型出发，进行三步操作：(i)在未标记代码混合文本上继续预训练获得适应检查点，(ii)将检查点与基础模型合并，(iii)在下游任务数据上微调。

Result: 合并模型在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语的句子分类任务中始终优于完全微调和CPT->FT方法，F1分数提升2-5点。在跨语言对迁移测试中，合并检查点比单语英语基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 模型合并比单独使用继续预训练能更有效地利用未标记数据，代码混合知识是低资源语言对更可靠的基板。论文还提供了针对不同数据情况的适应方案。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Zhengyu Zhou,Jun Araki,Xingbo Wang,Bingqing Wang,Suhang Wang,Zhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolDreamer是一个框架，通过使用LLM生成假设性的工具描述来改进工具检索，使检索器能更好地理解用户查询与工具之间的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索模型基于用户查询与工具描述的相似性进行工具排名，但由于用户请求通常与工具描述语言不匹配，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolDreamer框架，使用LLM生成假设性的合成工具描述，让检索器基于这些描述来获取工具，从而在工具描述的语言空间内实现更自然的查询-工具对齐。

Result: 在ToolRet数据集上应用ToolDreamer，提高了稀疏和密集检索器的性能，无论是否经过训练都表现出改进，展示了该框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在将部分推理负担转移到检索器上，使LLM能够有效处理大量工具而不会超出其上下文窗口限制。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架，通过优化提示空间（自然性、文化适应和难度增强）来改进多语言LLM性能，相比单纯翻译方法获得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言合成数据主要依赖翻译式提示，这继承了英语中心框架和风格，忽略了文化维度，限制了模型泛化能力

Method: 引入轻量级提示空间优化框架，系统地将翻译提示转化为自然性、文化适应和难度增强的版本

Result: 在12种语言上测试，相比单纯翻译基线获得显著提升：Global-MMLU准确率+4.7%，Flores XCometXL +2.4%，mArenaHard偏好胜率+35.3%

Conclusion: 提示空间优化是构建更稳健、文化基础和全球能力更强的多语言LLM的简单而强大的范式

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hubble是一套用于研究LLM记忆机制的开源大语言模型，包含标准模型和扰动模型，通过控制文本插入来模拟记忆风险，揭示了训练数据频率对记忆的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM记忆机制，特别是敏感数据在训练过程中的记忆风险，为理解和缓解LLM记忆问题提供实证基础。

Method: 开发标准模型和扰动模型，在训练过程中控制插入文本（如书籍段落、传记、测试集），分析不同参数规模和训练数据量下的记忆行为。

Result: 发现记忆风险取决于敏感数据在训练语料中的相对频率，敏感数据在较小语料中更容易被记忆，且没有持续暴露的敏感数据会被遗忘。

Conclusion: 提出了缓解记忆风险的最佳实践：通过增加训练语料规模稀释敏感数据，以及让敏感数据在训练早期出现；Hubble为记忆研究、成员推断和机器遗忘提供了理想测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一个可视化辅助工具来评估图顶点排序技术，特别关注城市分析应用。该工具整合了现有和新提出的指标，帮助用户选择合适的排序方法、调整超参数并识别排序失真区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图顶点排序在空间数据分析中广泛应用，特别是在城市分析中。但现有评估指标通常关注全局质量，难以识别局部失真。可视化评估对于比较不同方法、识别异常区域和解释空间不一致性特别有价值。

Method: 开发了一个可视化辅助工具，整合现有和新提出的评估指标。使用城市街道图评估几何和拓扑排序方法，通过多个城市数据的实验进行验证。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的方法能有效支持用户选择合适的顶点排序技术、调整超参数，并识别具有高排序失真的区域。

Conclusion: 该可视化辅助工具为评估图顶点排序技术提供了有效的方法，特别适用于城市分析场景，能够帮助用户更好地理解和选择排序方法。

Abstract: Graph vertex ordering is widely employed in spatial data analysis, especially
in urban analytics, where street graphs serve as spatial discretization for
modeling and simulation. It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods
require vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial
patterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood
relations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces
distortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to
identify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for
assessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which
hinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is
particularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single
visualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban
contexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a
visualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a
focus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering
approaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and
newly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple
cities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports
users in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,
and identifying regions with high ordering distortions.

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架，将可验证的测试时缩放建模为传输问题，揭示了生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的几何交互关系，并识别出三个不同的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时缩放与验证已显示出改善大型语言模型性能的潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究仅捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们交互几何的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时缩放构建为传输问题，分析覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和次优性之间的相互作用。提出并分析了两类采样算法——顺序和批处理，并研究了它们的计算复杂性如何影响这些权衡。

Result: 理论分析表明次优性-覆盖率曲线呈现三个机制：传输机制（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进机制（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和机制（次优性趋于平稳，不受覆盖率影响）。使用Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型的实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过传输问题框架，本文为理解测试时缩放中验证器的作用提供了统一视角，揭示了覆盖率、验证器性能和采样算法之间的复杂交互关系，为优化LLM性能提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ACTMED是一个结合贝叶斯实验设计和大型语言模型的临床诊断框架，通过逐步选择能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试来优化诊断过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中使用的顺序性、资源感知推理。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错。

Method: 将贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型集成，LLM作为灵活模拟器生成患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化任务特定训练数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 这是迈向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统的一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法来解决基于人类偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，通过学习群体不变核来提升奖励模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习中，偏好奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回复长度、讨好语气等）来获得高奖励分数，而不是真正反映预期目标。

Method: 受核视角中的不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的群体不变核，来缓解偏好奖励学习中的捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法一致提高了奖励模型在不同分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健的框架，有效缓解了奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在音频理解方面的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本性弱点，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来探测基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型（Gemini Pro和Flash、Qwen2.5-Omni、Audio-Flamingo 3）并与200人的人类基线对比。

Result: SOTA模型能力差异很大，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平，暴露出严重的感知缺陷。思维链提示效果不一致且通常有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准测试为评估不变音乐表征和开发更鲁棒的AI系统提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医疗领域快速扩展，但这些系统根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力仍不清楚，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较两个代表性LLMs。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格的转变、明确的不确定性表达和替代解释模式。

Conclusion: 结果强调了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但其逐步思考过程常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出方法旨在减少这种计算负担。

Method: 通过实证研究比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用内部信息的方法，分析了它们在模式选择任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数情况下表现更好但仍存在稳定性问题。

Conclusion: 现有仅依赖模型提供信息的方法在有限信息场景下不足以有效解决模式选择问题，突显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要简化为二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹的符合度，忽略了基准数据集中存在的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，规范编码动作，合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 对来自六个网页智能体的数千条轨迹进行评估，显示图抽象能够捕捉跨模型规律、突出冗余和低效，并识别被基于结果的指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网页智能体的多路径、跨智能体和效率感知评估建立了通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是与正则表达式基线对比，而非仅与人类表现比较，以揭示AI在复杂推理任务中的根本局限。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT与正则表达式(Regex)作为基线进行比较，分析其在提取法律原则关键段落任务中的表现。

Result: ChatGPT即使拥有必要知识和能力，也无法整合推理得出全面结果，显示出在复杂问题分解和综合解决方面的重大缺陷。

Conclusion: 真正的智能包括分解复杂问题并运用多种能力提供统一全面解决方案的能力，这在法律领域仍是人类独有的特质，AI存在根本性局限。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Motivation: 传统先例推理假设先例集必须一致，而广义理由模型放松了这一假设。目前已有基于传统一致理由模型的论证性解释方法，但针对容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架尚无相应的论证性解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，以解释基于广义理由模型的推理过程。

Conclusion: 成功将DSA-framework扩展到广义理由模型，填补了在容纳不一致先例的推理框架中缺乏论证性解释方法的空白。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体是否能重现人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，以及什么记忆和学习机制能够促成这种动态的出现。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和上下文学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了一个原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，解决强化学习中的灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率问题，在三个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过持续知识适应有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移，在持续强化学习场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

### [165] [MSC-Bench: A Rigorous Benchmark for Multi-Server Tool Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19423)
*Jia-Kai Dong,I-Wei Huang,Chun-Tin Wu,Yi-Tien Tsai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在多跳、端到端工具编排能力的大规模基准测试，通过构建"等函数集"作为真实标签，使用F1分数等客观指标，减少对LLM作为评估器的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。MSC-Bench旨在解决这些差距。

Method: 采用五级课程设计，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划系统测试代理能力，并测试对超出范围请求的鲁棒性。通过构建等函数集作为真实标签来减少对LLM评估的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，僵化的层次结构在没有协同设计策略时会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架来暴露这些限制，并指导开发更强大、更高效的工具使用代理。基准测试和资源已公开可用。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

### [166] [NeSyPr: Neurosymbolic Proceduralization For Efficient Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19429)
*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型能够在单步推理中执行多步符号推理，适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中语言模型进行具身任务时面临的大规模推理引擎或符号规划器在线访问受限问题，包括延迟、连接性和资源限制。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定计划，然后将这些计划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合程序表示，最后将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，支持无需外部符号指导的高效测试时推理，适合部署在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DAIL方法解决语言指令歧义问题，通过分布策略和语义对齐提升智能体对自然语言指令的理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致任务间存在大量歧义，严重影响算法性能

Method: DAIL方法包含两个核心组件：分布策略（增强任务可区分性）和语义对齐模块（捕捉轨迹与语言指令的对应关系）

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试中，DAIL有效解决指令歧义，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习有效解决了语言指令的歧义问题，提升了智能体对自然语言的理解和指令执行能力

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

### [168] [HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)
*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电子商务基准，要求代理根据复杂规则预测产品的10位协调制度代码，现有最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册、关税规则）的能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐含逻辑关系，对代理提出了重要挑战。

Method: 从大规模电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，由多位人类专家标注HSCode。通过分层规则指导代理的深度推理过程来预测产品代码。

Result: 在多个最先进的LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%。测试时扩展无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: HSCodeComp基准揭示了深度搜索代理在分层规则应用方面的显著不足，表明当前代理在处理复杂规则推理方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense是一个基于多智能体进化系统的混合训练免费框架，将大语言模型集成到参与式城市感知中，通过迭代优化解决方案来适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时提供自然语言解释增强透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性，需要开发能够适应动态条件并提供透明解释的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合训练免费框架，结合经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，使感知任务分配适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，并生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性方面表现更优，提供更合理透明的解释。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于网络的城市管理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于图论的吉他即兴演奏建议引擎，通过构建和弦音阶图并计算最优路径来生成和弦音独奏线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 和弦音独奏是爵士吉他即兴演奏的基础技能，但学习和练习难度较大，需要为学生提供有效的练习工具。

Method: 首先生成和弦音阶，构建加权图（节点代表和弦音阶，边权重基于最优过渡音计算），然后寻找最短路径并重构独奏线。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够为吉他学生提供和弦音独奏建议，帮助他们练习即兴演奏。

Conclusion: 该图论引擎为吉他学生提供了有效的和弦音独奏练习工具，有助于掌握爵士吉他即兴演奏的基础技能。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的电子竞技流式胜利预测分类解决方案，通过滑动窗口控制输入数据来反映游戏变化，准确率超过90%，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子竞技观众和玩家数量增长，加上通信技术和云计算发展，推动了在线游戏产业发展。传统AI解决方案主要关注批量分类而忽略了可视化技术，需要可解释的流式预测方法。

Method: 采用流式处理方式，通过多个滑动窗口控制输入数据以反映游戏变化，并包含可解释性模块来增强预测结果的可信度。

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中的竞争解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用进行明智决策，可解释性模块有助于建立对预测结果的信任。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [172] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集，通过规则生成、逻辑回归、迭代优化和评估四个阶段实现更可靠的神经符号推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法忽视了规则间的相互作用，且LLM与概率规则学习结合进行稳健推理的机会尚未充分探索。

Method: RLIE框架包含四个阶段：LLM生成和筛选候选规则；逻辑回归学习概率权重；基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 直接应用学习权重的规则可获得优越性能，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM反而会降低准确性，表明LLM擅长语义生成但概率整合能力较弱。

Conclusion: RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现了更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一种基于Transformer的架构和训练方法，用于解决强化学习中需要长期记忆的任务。它通过在训练时插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在计算和存储效率上优于传统长上下文Transformer方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的具身智能体策略在处理视觉输入时经常超出上下文限制，而人类能够将终身经验压缩为记忆使用。现有方法要么使用固定大小的循环记忆，要么依赖完整上下文，缺乏有效的记忆压缩机制。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在训练过程中交替输入周期性总结标记，实现记忆的创建和检索。该方法在网格世界元强化学习基准和真实室内多目标导航任务上进行验证。

Result: Memo在记忆密集型长期任务上表现优于传统长上下文Transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高。在推理时对更长上下文有更好的泛化能力，在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo通过记忆压缩机制有效解决了Transformer在具身决策任务中的上下文限制问题，为长期记忆的具身智能体提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了PROBE基准来评估LLM智能体的主动性能力，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力。

Method: 设计PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是先进模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest是一个评估模型学习智能体的协议，将无奖励交互与不同但相关环境中的评分测试阶段分离，支持多种未知任务，并允许跨方法比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型的学习和评估方法偏离了核心目标：训练和评估局限于下一帧预测，成功标准是在相同环境中的奖励最大化。需要一种更全面的评估协议。

Method: 提出WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、衍生测试和行为评分三个模板。实例化为AutumnBench套件，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测三个任务族。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，计算规模扩展只在某些环境中提高性能而非所有环境。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个新颖的模板来评估智能体对环境动态的学习情况，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著提升空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.
