Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统评估方法来分析和量化说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，包括三种测试设置和衍生指标，为未来研究建立更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持说话者一致性的同时，可能会引入嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，这难以通过标准指标检测。

Method: 使用三种互补测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对和匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入嘴唇同步差异和基于静音音频的嘴唇同步分数等衍生指标。

Result: 开发了一个模型无关的评估框架，能够有效检测和量化嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的评估基准，有助于未来更好地理解和解决嘴唇泄漏问题。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)

TL;DR: 提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态监控中的行人跟踪问题，在复杂遮挡环境下保持约90%的检测和跟踪准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多无人机监控系统在动态相机位置和复杂遮挡环境下表现不佳，需要更全面的数据集和算法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个动态位置无人机同步拍摄）和深度学习框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图多视图特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%的检测跟踪准确率，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，迁移学习和相机失效实验显示良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供了重要基准，在复杂环境下显著优于静态相机方法。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [4] [Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633)
*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过使用粗糙参考动画作为运动线索，结合双时钟去噪策略，实现精确的运动和外观控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要特定模型微调的方法计算成本高且受限。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或深度重投影）获取粗糙参考动画作为运动线索，结合图像条件保持外观，采用双时钟去噪策略在运动指定区域强制对齐，同时在其他区域保持灵活性。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实性和运动控制方面匹配或超越了现有的基于训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的视频生成解决方案，能够实现精确的运动和外观控制，超越了仅使用文本提示的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [5] [Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628)
*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmannian流形的拓扑驱动多子空间融合框架，通过自适应子空间协作来增强几何表示学习能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态单子空间表示，忽略了多子空间之间的动态交互对捕捉复杂几何结构的重要性

Method: 1) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的自适应多子空间建模机制，通过拓扑收敛分析动态选择和加权任务相关子空间；2) 多子空间交互块，通过流形上的Fréchet均值优化融合异构几何表示

Result: 在3D动作识别(HDM05, FPHA)、EEG分类(MAMEM-SSVEPII)和图任务上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了几何深度学习，还成功将欧几里得网络中经过验证的多通道交互理念适应到非欧几里得领域，实现了优越的判别性和可解释性

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [6] [OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OUGS框架，通过基于3D高斯原语物理参数的显式不确定性建模，结合语义分割实现对象感知的主动视图选择，显著提升了3D高斯溅射在目标对象重建中的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动重建方法依赖场景级不确定性度量，容易受到无关背景干扰，导致对象中心任务的视图选择效率低下。需要更原则性的物理基础不确定性公式来解决这一挑战。

Method: 从3D高斯原语的物理参数（位置、尺度、旋转）直接推导不确定性，通过渲染雅可比传播协方差建立可解释的不确定性模型，并集成语义分割掩码生成目标对象感知的不确定性分数。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了3DGS重建过程的效率，相比现有最先进方法在目标对象上实现了更高质量的重建，同时作为全局场景的鲁棒不确定性估计器。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知的视图选择策略，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象高效高保真重建的挑战，为3DGS重建提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

### [7] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的记忆库持续异常检测框架，所有任务共享单一记忆库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，避免任务特定的内存碎片化，在推理时使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子记忆库，限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用统一记忆库框架，所有任务共享单一记忆库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在推理阶段采用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上取得最先进的检测精度，平均图像级AUROC分别为0.972和0.891，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续异常检测任务中表现出优越性能，验证了统一记忆库框架的有效性和在实际场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的演员-评论家模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，解决传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对主动安全驾驶至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：(1)天气、运动模糊或硬件限制导致的传感器输入噪声或退化；(2)需要在早期警报和误报抑制之间平衡的及时可靠预测需求。

Method: 集成扩散去噪和时间感知演员-批评家模型的统一框架。扩散模块通过迭代细化重建噪声弹性图像和对象特征，在传感器退化下保留关键运动和交互线索。演员-批评家架构利用长时程时间推理和时间加权奖励来确定最佳警报时机。

Conclusion: 该框架具有在现实世界安全关键部署中的潜力，能够平衡早期检测与可靠性，为自动驾驶系统提供更有效的事故预警能力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RS-Net框架，通过空间交互和长程时间上下文对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，提升动态场景图生成性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSGG方法仅在有标注的物体对上训练，缺乏对非相关物体对的指导，导致推理时难以识别有意义的关系

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时间编码器，通过统一的三元组评分机制增强关系预测

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，RS-Net显著提升Recall和Precision，特别是在mean Recall上有明显增益，优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: RS-Net能有效解决关系长尾分布问题，可轻松集成到现有DSGG模型中，在保持竞争力的效率下实现更优性能

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [10] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名化适配器模块移除视频特征中的私人信息，同时保持任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在共享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），现有像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且不适用于视频基础模型。

Method: 设计轻量级匿名化适配器模块（AAM），采用三种训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 在多种下游任务中显著减少35%的隐私泄露，同时保持接近基线的效用性能，并能有效缓解动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，既能保护敏感信息又能维持模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的扩展特性，发现最优扩展策略高度依赖具体任务，且计算资源比训练数据量更可能成为主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但研究不足的统一视觉模型框架的扩展特性，了解不同视觉任务下的最优扩展策略。

Method: 在32x32分辨率图像上训练一系列Transformer模型，使用IsoFlops配置在高达7e19 FLOPs的计算预算下评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量。

Result: 发现分类和生成任务的最优扩展策略存在显著差异，生成任务需要数据量以3-5倍更快的速度增长；随着分辨率增加，模型大小需要比数据量增长更快；计算资源是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 基于计算资源每年增长4-5倍的预测，逐像素图像建模在未来五年内具有可行性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Method: 使用LoRA和DreamBooth等扩散模型微调技术，通过聚类组内图像并为每个聚类训练DreamBooth模型来生成平衡数据，然后进行预训练和在真实数据上的微调。

Result: 实验表明，所研究的微调方法在平均表现上优于原始Stable Diffusion，与SOTA去偏技术如Group-DRO结果相当，并在数据集偏见严重时超越它们。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成平衡训练数据，缓解数据偏见问题，特别是在偏见严重的数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: SIFT-Graph是一个多模态防御框架，通过结合手工特征和深度学习特征来增强传统视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度视觉模型依赖密集的像素级表示，对微小扰动高度敏感，而传统防御策略缺乏整合固有鲁棒视觉特征的机制。

Method: 集成尺度不变特征变换关键点与图注意力网络，提取对扰动具有弹性的局部结构特征，然后与传统视觉模型融合。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法有效提高了视觉模型对基于梯度的白盒对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时仅导致清洁准确率轻微下降。

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph框架通过结合结构感知特征，成功提升了视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性，为防御对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的旋转不变3D点云学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野限制导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题，能够区分几何相似但空间不同的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工制作的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然对任意旋转具有鲁棒性，但会丢失全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间不同的结构（如左右机翼）。

Method: 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点（阴影），将局部RI描述符与全局姿态信息结合；设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)集成SiPF；基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块动态学习最优全局旋转。

Conclusion: 通过结合局部旋转不变特征和全局姿态信息，该方法成功解决了现有RI方法的局限性，在保持旋转不变性的同时增强了空间区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Motivation: 现有基于SSM的方法通过手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时间序列，破坏了人体姿态的固有空间结构，导致空间和时间特征纠缠，难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系。

Method: 提出SAS-SSM：1）使用结构感知的时空卷积动态捕捉关节间的局部交互；2）采用跨步扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息。

Conclusion: SAS-SSM能够有效解决现有SSM方法中空间结构破坏和特征纠缠的问题，为3D人体姿态估计提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Conclusion: MFAVBs通过显式特征融合和多重增强操作，有效提升了对比学习在图像聚类任务中的性能。

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

Conclusion: 模型在训练数据上表现优异，但泛化到新数据存在挑战，这对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上，与7种现有方法相比实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识传输挑战，在遥感场景分类中表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了分层蒸馏（HD）框架，将轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏从独立范式转变为协同组件，通过轨迹蒸馏建立结构"草图"，再用分布蒸馏进行细化，结合自适应加权判别器（AWD）实现高效细节优化，在单步扩散模型中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了稳健的新范式，通过协同利用轨迹和分布蒸馏的优势，解决了推理延迟问题。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了NAMEA集成攻击方法，通过融合异构模型中非注意力区域的梯度来提升对抗样本的跨架构迁移性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击在跨异构模型架构迁移时效果不佳，主要是因为异构代理模型的梯度更新方向差异很大，难以在利用单个模型优势的同时减少集成模型的梯度方差

Method: 设计NAMEA集成攻击，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度整合到迭代梯度优化过程中。通过解耦注意力和非注意力区域的梯度，并使用元学习进行梯度融合

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，NAMEA比最先进的集成攻击方法AdaEA和SMER分别平均提升了15.0%和9.6%的攻击成功率

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的思路

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究较少，其分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层级，造成两个参考帧的贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出了BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛(BMC)和双向上下文融合(BCF)。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明BRHVC超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超过了传统编码VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: BRHVC通过更高效的运动和上下文信息，能够有效协调双向参考帧，显著提升了神经B帧视频压缩的性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGMs)能生成高质量图像，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性，需要解决多样性不足的问题

Method: 1) 提出可学习的HD估计方法从图像嵌入直接预测HD；2) 采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动调度策略；3) 在推理时使用HD引导的拒绝采样选择几何更丰富的输出

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，相比原始FGMs，FGM-HD框架将输出多样性提升了39%，同时保持了相当的图像质量

Conclusion: 这是首个将HD引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

TL;DR: AuthSig是一个基于生成模型和水印的静态电子签名框架，通过将认证信息嵌入签名图像来解决静态签名易被恶意复制和重用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，传统墨水签名正转向电子格式。虽然存在动态压力敏感和PKI数字签名，但静态扫描签名因其便利性仍广泛使用。然而这些静态图像几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且易被恶意复制和重用。

Method: 利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特性，AuthSig在生成过程中精细调节风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位，实现"一次签名，一次使用"策略。为解决手写签名数据稀缺问题，引入了关键点驱动的数据增强策略来增强风格多样性。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下实现了超过98%的提取准确率，在打印扫描场景中仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig通过将认证信息绑定到签名图像，有效解决了静态电子签名的安全性和可靠性问题。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Method: 使用聚类剪枝构建多样化核心集，结合双重检索机制实现全局演示选择。

Result: 实验表明CoDR显著提升了ICL性能，优于现有策略。

Conclusion: CoDR为演示选择提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Conclusion: WDT-MD框架显著提升了微血管瘤检测性能，为改善早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Conclusion: 负向提示成为推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni支持灵活的正向专用和联合正负推理模式部署。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Conclusion: Owl通过建模视觉-文本注意力交互和动态干预机制，有效缓解了物体幻觉问题，同时保持了视觉语言理解能力。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

TL;DR: 4KDehazeFlow是一种基于流匹配和雾感知向量场的超高清图像去雾方法，通过渐进式优化连续向量场流实现高效的数据驱动自适应非线性色彩变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高清图像去雾面临的挑战：先验方法场景适应性有限，深度学习方法计算复杂度高且存在色彩失真。

Method: 提出可学习的3D查找表编码雾变换参数，使用四阶龙格-库塔ODE求解器稳定求解去雾流场，兼容各种深度学习网络架构。

Result: 在实验中超过7种最先进方法，PSNR提高2dB，在浓雾场景和色彩保真度方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 4KDehazeFlow提供了一种高效、通用的超高清图像去雾解决方案，能够有效抑制伪影并保持色彩保真度。

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN是一个通用、可交互、长视野的世界模型，通过高质量视频模拟预测未来世界状态，结合自回归潜在动态骨干和视频扩散解码器，实现潜在空间推理与世界动态的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且泛化能力有限。需要构建能够跨领域泛化、支持自然语言动作控制的世界模型。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构：基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态骨干，结合视频扩散解码器。在大型视频-动作对数据集上训练，支持开放领域、动作条件模拟。

Result: 实验表明PAN在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN向通用世界模型迈进了一步，能够为推理和行为提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉问答系统在处理文化特定内容时存在局限，因为训练数据中文化知识不足且推理过程不够透明。

Method: 集成文化对象检测骨干网络和结构化程序生成层，构建包含文化实体知识库的双模态解释模块。

Result: 构建了越南文化VQA数据集，展示了基于编程方法在文化AI中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该系统提供透明解释，揭示计算原理和文化背景，支持教育和文化保护，强调可解释性和文化敏感性。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

TL;DR: 提出了DOC方法，通过正交梯度方向和动量更新增强对抗性攻击的多样性，提高视觉语言预训练模型在测试时的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对抗方法TTC由于优化目标差异，仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成反攻击，导致搜索空间狭窄，反攻击多样性不足，无法充分中和广泛的对抗扰动。

Method: 提出方向正交反攻击(DOC)，通过正交梯度方向和动量更新扩展反攻击空间探索，增加扰动多样性；同时基于平均余弦相似度提出方向敏感度评分，提升样本区分度和自适应调节反攻击强度。

Result: 在16个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC通过正交梯度探索和动量更新有效实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Motivation: 现实世界数据不断涌现，组合数量近乎无限且呈长尾分布，需要模型以增量方式逐步提升组合泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于伪重放的框架，使用视觉合成器合成已学组合的视觉表示，并通过语言基元蒸馏机制在学习过程中保持对齐的基元表示。

Result: 在MIT-States-CompIL和C-GQA-CompIL基准上的大量实验证明了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: CompIL框架能够有效支持组合增量学习，逐步提升模型的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UL-TTA是一种无需训练和反向传播的测试时适应框架，通过在线EM风格方法仅调整logit级参数（类别原型、先验和温度），在领域偏移下显著提升CLIP等视觉语言模型的准确性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法需要反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，不适用于流式和边缘场景。VLMs在领域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和严重校准错误问题。

Method: 冻结主干网络，仅在线调整logit级参数：使用选择性样本过滤、基于文本和Dirichlet先验的闭式贝叶斯更新、解耦的温度参数，以及轻量级防护机制防止长期流中的漂移。

Result: 在多个大规模跨域和OOD基准测试中，UL-TTA平均比零样本CLIP提升4.7个百分点准确率，ECE降低20-30%，延迟开销小于8%，在长达20万样本的流中无崩溃。

Conclusion: logit级贝叶斯适应足以在领域偏移下为VLMs获得最先进的准确率-校准权衡，无需更新任何主干参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Motivation: 现有的OCR方法在干净的Kuzushiji文档上表现良好，但无法有效处理文档退化和印章等噪声，且缺乏专门针对这些挑战的数据集。

Method: 构建了DKDS数据集，包含两个基准任务：1）文本和印章检测（使用YOLO模型）；2）文档二值化（使用传统算法、K-means聚类和GAN方法）。

Result: 提供了基线结果，展示了不同方法在文本和印章检测以及文档二值化任务上的性能。

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji文档识别中噪声处理的数据空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和基线方法。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Motivation: 传统洪水测绘方法如数值建模和航空摄影在效率和可靠性方面存在局限性，需要开发更高效可靠的洪水深度估计方法。

Method: 基于图像到图像的生成框架，结合简化淹没模型嵌入水动力先验知识，使用基于Transformer的降雨编码器捕捉降水时间依赖性，将物理约束与数据驱动学习相结合。

Result: 在台湾台南26公里研究区域使用182个降雨情景（24小时降雨量24-720毫米）进行测试，结果表明PIFF为洪水预测和响应提供了有效的数据驱动替代方案。

Conclusion: PIFF通过整合物理信息约束和数据驱动学习，能够准确捕捉降雨、地形、简化淹没模型与洪水之间的因果关系，实现准确、实时的洪水测绘。

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Result: 在9个开放任务和23个大模型上的实验表明，MACEval具有自动化、高效经济、灵活可扩展等优势。

Conclusion: MACEval为大模型评估开辟了新方向，能够可持续地量化模型性能。

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了仅使用压力信号实现多人全局人体网格恢复的可行性，为无处不在、保护隐私的多人动作识别开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Result: 在CS-Wild-Places数据集上平均Recall@1达到90.7%，比基线提高29.6个百分点；在Wild-Places和MulRan数据集上分别达到91.7%和96.0%；97.2%的6-DoF配准尝试误差小于2米和5度；运行时间比RANSAC快两个数量级。

Conclusion: HOTFLoc++在具有挑战性的森林环境中实现了最先进的性能，通过多尺度重排序模块显著降低了定位误差，为跨模态LiDAR定位提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频技术快速发展，对内容安全和取证分析构成严重挑战。现有检测器主要依赖像素级视觉线索，对未见过的生成器泛化能力差。

Method: 通过扩散模型反演恢复初始噪声序列，发现真实视频和生成视频的初始噪声序列存在系统性差异。基于此构建初始噪声差异序列(INDS)，提取多领域、多尺度特征，结合特征优化和贝叶斯搜索调优的LightGBM分类器。

Result: 在GenVidBench基准测试中，DBINDS（仅使用单一生成器训练）实现了强大的跨生成器性能，在有限数据设置下表现出良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DBINDS通过分析潜在空间动态而非像素特征，有效解决了AI生成视频检测的泛化问题，为内容安全和取证分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型越来越多地用于直接从图像生成皮肤病诊断叙述，但可靠的评估仍然是临床负责任部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建了DermBench基准测试（包含4000个真实皮肤病图像和专家认证的诊断叙述），并使用LLM评分器对候选叙述进行临床维度评分；训练了DermEval无参考多模态评估器，能够根据图像和生成叙述产生结构化批评和评分。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了临床意义、可重复且可扩展的评估，为识别模型局限性和偏见提供了细粒度的逐病例分析能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: TACO是一个通过自验证和置信度校准来减少多模态大语言模型幻觉的框架，无需外部视觉专家，在多个基准测试中表现优于直接提示和视觉对比解码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: TACO将响应分解为原子查询，通过改写减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）和两个MLLM模型上的实验表明，TACO持续优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统性偏差，改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO能有效增强多模态大语言模型的忠实性，证明了其缓解幻觉问题的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出空间信息瓶颈(S-IB)框架，从信息论角度理解梯度归因，通过优化VJP的空间结构在训练中实现特征解耦，提升模型可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常学习空间纠缠的表示，将判别性前景特征与虚假背景相关性混在一起，削弱了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 从信息论角度提出编码-解码视角：前向传播将输入编码到类别空间，反向传播中的VJP将此编码解码回特征空间。通过最大化前景VJP与输入的互信息，同时最小化背景区域的互信息，实现空间信息解耦。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在六种解释方法上均获得普遍改进，实现了更好的前景集中和背景抑制，同时保持分类准确性的稳定提升。

Conclusion: S-IB框架通过直接优化VJP的空间结构，有效提升了模型的可解释性，为梯度归因方法提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Motivation: 动画生成编解码器在资源受限的边缘设备上部署面临参数多、算法适应性差和高功耗等挑战，需要高效的硬件加速方案。

Method: 采用网络压缩方法（静态量化和层融合），设计基于协处理器范式的重叠加速器，包含卷积、网格采样等硬件引擎，并应用双缓冲流水线和循环展开等并行优化策略。

Conclusion: 提出的FPGA部署方案有效解决了动画生成编解码器在边缘设备上的部署挑战，实现了显著的能效提升。

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少区分神经网络架构和信号选择的作用，本文旨在系统评估这两个方面对能量消耗估计的影响。

Method: 比较经典基线方法与新型神经网络架构，评估单信号、信号对和分组传感器输入在不同身体活动中的表现，使用Transformer、CNN和ResNet等模型。

Result: 分钟通气量是最佳单信号，Transformer模型在所有活动中RMSE最低为0.87 W/kg。低强度活动表现更好（RMSE低至0.29 W/kg），高强度活动误差较大但标准化误差相当。个体间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 信号选择和模型架构对能量消耗估计都很重要，个体间变异性强调需要自适应建模策略，Hexoskin智能衬衫等多信号组合为快速模型提供良好替代方案。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽视了跨模态表示的潜力。本文探索使用CLIP的视觉语言知识作为补充监督源。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，融合传统教师和CLIP的logit与特征，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，捕获数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，RichKD在多个基准测试中表现优异，并在分布偏移和输入损坏下展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化中的关键挑战，实现了高效部署，显著优于现有PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了TDCNet网络，通过时间差分卷积重参数化模块和多尺度运动上下文特征提取，结合时空注意力机制，显著提升了移动红外小目标检测性能。

Conclusion: TDCNet通过有效提取和增强时空特征，在复杂背景中抑制伪运动杂波，显著提升了移动红外小目标检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每帧3D姿态，无法有效解决模糊运动和泛化到真实场景的问题。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合高层意图和关节结构关系。

Method: 使用扩散模型框架，通过从2D姿态序列提取任务相关动作提示来动态调节去噪过程；引入表示编码器将运动学关节亲和性融入注意力机制；使用幻觉姿态解码器预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准数据集上达到最先进性能，在广播棒球数据集上也表现出色，能有效处理模糊和噪声2D输入，保持时间一致性和意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理、关节关系建模和时间想象力，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊和真实场景时表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过四类节点表示用户-LLM交互，在少样本数据下有效捕捉用户偏好，显著提升路由准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏完全个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM的复杂交互，且用户偏好数据稀疏、噪声大、格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互建模为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四类节点的异构图，通过定制化的消息传递机制，在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少样本数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线，准确率提高0.9-21.6%，AUC提高0.006-0.309，且仅需少样本数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过图学习方法有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下表现出色，为个性化LLM路由提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Motivation: 评估LLMs模拟社交媒体群组对话的有效性，探索其在内容推荐算法测试和内容政策影响评估等应用中的潜力。

Method: 收集Reddit真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o生成相同主题的人工对话，通过参与者侧对侧比较判断对话来源。

Result: LLM生成的对话被误认为人类创作的比例为39%，Llama 3生成的对话被正确识别为AI生成的概率仅56%。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，既展示了社交模拟的潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用于生成不真实社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

TL;DR: LLMs在解释复杂法律框架方面具有潜力，但也存在生成不安全输出的风险。研究提出结合知识图谱和RAG的方法评估LLMs对生物武器法律的理解能力，发现其推理和安全机制存在显著局限，但可通过增强安全协议和推理框架来改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs分析复杂法律框架（如美国法典第18章第175条关于生物武器的规定）具有变革潜力，但同时也面临LLMs可能生成不安全输出的矛盾问题，需要系统评估其法律理解能力和安全风险。

Method: 提出结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成（RAG）的方法论，通过结构化实验评估LLMs识别法律违规、生成禁止指令以及检测非法意图的能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但通过增强安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架可以改善其表现。

Conclusion: 通过结合增强的安全协议和更稳健的法律推理框架，这项研究为开发能够在敏感法律领域提供道德和安全协助的LLMs奠定了基础，确保它们成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违法促成者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

TL;DR: LLM对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）显著降低了模型输出的多样性，作者提出Soft Preference Learning方法来解决这个问题，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项来精细控制生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs对社会影响日益增大，其代表多元观点的能力至关重要。但现有对齐算法显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致文本结构重复、用词单一，且反映的社会观点范围变窄。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，从而能够精细控制LLM生成的多样性。

Result: 从能力角度看，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务上获得更高准确率，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性；从对齐角度看，能代表更广泛的社会观点并显示改进的logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能有效提升LLM输出的多样性而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

TL;DR: SSDP是一种轻量级方法，通过在线语义合并和动态剪枝来减少树状思维推理中的语义冗余，实现2.3倍加速，同时保持竞争性准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树状思维推理虽然提升了LLM的问题解决能力，但由于语义冗余导致计算成本高昂，需要探索等效推理路径的不同分支。

Method: 引入语义相似性动态剪枝(SSDP)，将在线语义合并集成到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，SSDP相比最先进的树搜索基线实现2.3倍加速，探索节点数减少85-90%，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，显著减少了计算开销同时保持了推理质量。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题严重阻碍LLMs在高风险领域的实际部署，需要评估模型在对抗性提示下的事实保真度。

Method: 三步骤框架：1) 让LLM生成特定领域的真假陈述；2) 让LLM验证这些陈述；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的鲁棒性。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域测试5个主流LLM：Claude表现最强韧性，GPT和Grok中等，Gemini和DeepSeek最弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多人使用LLMs进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，模型对自身生成谎言的脆弱性令人担忧。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

TL;DR: 提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用同一模型生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，验证其对自身防御的绕过能力。实验显示在零样本和少样本条件下分别达到33%和41%的越狱成功率，揭示了自动评估高估危害性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。本研究旨在验证LLM自身生成的有害查询能否绕过其安全防护。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用同一模型生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B上进行实验，包含基础、零样本和少样本条件，结合前缀自动评估和人工评估。

Result: 零样本条件下转换成功率最高52%，越狱成功率最高33%；少样本条件下转换成功率最高65%，越狱成功率最高41%。自动评估平均高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明是有效的攻击场景，表明需要重新考虑防护栏设计并建立更稳健的评估方法，自动评估单独使用不够准确。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

Motivation: 传统基于维基百科和教科书的静态基准无法捕捉动态世界中的知识演变，且集中式管理难以跟上LLM的快速发展。需要一种能够反映知识更新的评估方法。

Method: 提出OKBench框架，采用代理式方法自动化基准的获取、创建、验证和分发过程，重点关注新闻领域，减少与预训练数据的重叠。

Result: 评估了各种开源和专有LLM，结果显示模型在面对新信息时表现出不同行为，检索方法缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 在演化知识基准上评估LLM至关重要，OKBench框架能够民主化基准创建，促进检索增强方法的全面评估。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时费力。通用大语言模型虽然能生成文本，但缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容且需要大量专家修订。

Method: 开发了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识和工程化提示模板，支持5个商业(如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet)和开源(如Llama 3.2)大语言模型，设计了7个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证表明RAG增强的儿科言语语言病理学案例生成具有技术可行性。商业模型质量略优，但开源替代方案表现可接受，适合隐私保护的机构部署。知识库整合使生成内容符合专业指南。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了自动生成专业临床案例的潜力，但需要专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估等广泛验证。未来可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思训练等应用。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式化方法从英语扩展到孟加拉语，评估其在英-孟翻译任务中的有效性，特别是检验该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法基础框架，开发孟加拉语的类似形式化系统，并将其应用于英-孟翻译任务，同时分析英语连词与布尔逻辑的关系。

Result: 与先前研究结论不同，发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言处理有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译中仍面临限制，即使处理简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在跨语言翻译中存在约束，这突显了其局限性，同时也为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT在领域专业化时资源消耗大且容易导致灾难性遗忘，需要更高效的数据选择方法来提升微调效率。

Method: 通过分析初步训练阶段的梯度，设计基于梯度大小和统计分布的自引导标准，优先选择对模型学习贡献最大的训练样本。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等多个领域的实验中，仅使用5%的GrADS选择数据就能超越全数据集微调效果，使用50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法能够高效选择代表性样本，显著提升LLMs领域专业化微调的效率和效果，同时有效控制灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令经常导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更好的不确定性处理方法

Method: 将工具参数的结构化不确定性建模为POMDP，使用EVPI目标进行最优问题选择，采用基于方面的成本建模防止冗余

Result: 在ClarifyBench基准测试中表现优异，同时结构化不确定性为强化学习提供有效训练信号，显著提升When2Call准确率

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，在现实场景中同时提高了任务成功率和交互效率

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在复杂认知类别提取方面优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述，可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型家族：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型，用于提取七个认知类别。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别如思维和社交互动方面表现突出。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于复杂认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性质，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但这些NLP系统经过持续改进，有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

TL;DR: TACT数据集统一了任务导向对话和闲聊，支持双向模式切换，结合DPO优化显著提升了对话质量和过渡控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统将任务导向对话和闲聊分离，但真实对话需要在这两种模式间自然切换，现有系统缺乏这种过渡能力。

Method: 构建TACT数据集支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，并应用DPO优化模型。

Result: TACT训练模型在意图检测和模式切换处理上优于基线，DPO进一步提升了性能，达到75.74%联合模式-意图准确率和70.1%胜率。

Conclusion: 结构多样数据与DPO结合能显著提升对话代理的响应质量和过渡控制能力，推动更主动和过渡感知的对话系统发展。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成提供了标准化环境，展示了LLM代理在该领域的潜力，特别是通过多源信息整合和自评估机制能够产生更优质的假设。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

TL;DR: LLM生成参考文献的准确性与其在预训练语料中的出现频率（以引用次数为代理）密切相关，引用次数超过1000的论文几乎被逐字记忆，而引用次数低的论文更容易出现幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成参考文献时出现幻觉（虚构不存在的论文）的问题，探索引用频率如何影响LLM生成参考文献的准确性。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的引用，通过手动验证和余弦相似度测量生成引用与真实元数据之间的事实一致性。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性呈强相关；引用次数超过1000的论文几乎被逐字记忆；当多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: LLM存在从泛化到记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，这有助于理解LLM的知识表示机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型和自回归模型之间的权衡问题：扩散模型支持并行生成但质量较低，自回归模型质量高但生成效率低。现有方法无法有效平衡这两个方面。

Method: TiDAR采用混合架构，使用扩散模型进行草稿生成（Thinking），自回归模型进行最终采样（Talking），通过结构化注意力掩码在单个前向传播中实现。

Result: TiDAR在1.5B和8B规模上评估，吞吐量比自回归模型高4.71-5.91倍，质量与AR模型相当，优于推测解码和扩散变体。

Conclusion: TiDAR是首个在保持AR级别质量的同时显著提高吞吐量的架构，实现了扩散模型和自回归模型的优势结合。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Conclusion: LLM能够扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下数据集的质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹评估框架能够更全面地评估LLMs的长期情感支持性能，为情感AI的发展提供了有效的评估工具和方向指导。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语识别任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri对LLMs进行多维度幽默能力评估，发现LLMs在生成幽默内容方面达到中低人类水平，但缺乏共情能力，且与人类在幽默评估标准上存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖单维度评估LLMs的幽默能力，本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，通过Oogiri这种即兴喜剧形式来系统评估LLMs的幽默能力。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，用LLMs生成Oogiri回应，然后人工标注六个维度的5分绝对评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性和整体趣味性。

Result: LLMs能生成中低人类水平的幽默回应，但明显缺乏共情能力；LLMs与人类在幽默评估标准上存在根本差异：LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评估方面存在共情能力不足的问题，这解释了它们无法复制人类幽默评估的原因。发布标注语料库以推动开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: RoPE位置编码存在限制，削弱了长度外推能力。研究发现注意力图中存在异常频率带导致的注意力下沉现象，影响了长上下文处理性能。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，基于截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，并使用参数自由的高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现稳健外推。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具学习受限于静态合成数据管道，数据生成和模型训练分离，无法自适应关注模型弱点，且存在噪声标签问题，影响训练效率。

Method: LoopTool包含三个协同模块：贪婪能力探测诊断模型能力；判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型纠正标注错误；错误驱动数据扩展基于识别失败生成新挑战样本。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，在开源生态系统中实现高效训练。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Result: 在NTCIR-18 U4共享任务的TQA数据集上达到74.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o mini的63.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了表格问答性能，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来缩小与人工评估的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的作文数据集(ASAP++和ELLIPSE)，比较不同sequentiality版本与人类评估的一致性，并分析其与标准语言特征结合时的预测能力

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分和相关NLP任务

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，本研究旨在探索如果语言模型能够动态优化分词，其子词在训练过程中如何演化，特别是在不同形态类型的语言中。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架以支持预训练和微调，在三种形态类型不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)上进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调时子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能改善低资源、形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习子词为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词分割的动态学习能更好地适应不同语言的形态特征。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要优化最终任务结果，在早期训练中负奖励占主导时容易导致模型崩溃，特别是在诚实对齐任务中，模型需要既能回答可解答的查询，也能识别无法从前提得出结论的情况。

Method: 提出Anchor强化学习方法，将真实轨迹注入rollouts以防止早期训练崩溃；使用从图结构构建的两个多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），其中一半实例通过随机扰动边来引入不可回答的情况。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于实现对齐语言模型中可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过防止早期训练崩溃有效解决了诚实对齐中的挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Conclusion: C³TG是无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LiteraryTaste数据集，用于研究个性化创意写作偏好，发现人们偏好差异显著，基于Transformer的模型能有效建模个人偏好，但自我报告偏好的预测效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作任务中需要适应不同用户的偏好，但现有数据集往往将个人品味视为整体，缺乏个性化建模的基础。

Method: 构建包含60人阅读偏好的LiteraryTaste数据集，收集自我报告偏好和100对创意写作文本的标注偏好，使用Transformer编码器进行微调建模。

Result: 1) 人们创意写作偏好存在显著差异；2) Transformer模型对个人和集体揭示偏好的建模准确率分别达到75.8%和67.7%；3) 自我报告偏好对揭示偏好的预测效果有限。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化创意写作技术发展奠定了基础，强调了直接建模用户行为偏好的重要性。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并公开了新的高棉语极性数据集和微调模型。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptDel方法，通过自适应删除率来改进序列分类的认证鲁棒性，针对编辑距离扰动提供理论保证和显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理变长序列输入（如自然语言句子）导致性能不佳，需要适应不同输入特性的动态调整机制。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可适应删除率根据输入属性动态调整，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到变率删除场景。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中值基数比最先进方法提升高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率有效提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，评估发现前沿VLMs在复杂推理任务上表现优异，但开源模型表现不佳，且当推理负载增加时模型性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法充分区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的基准来评估模型的真实推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含1,460道JEE Advanced考试题目的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估了17个最先进模型。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，但开源模型仅为37-45%；当增加元认知推理负载时，GPT-5只能修正5.2%的错误。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准能有效区分优秀的训练和推理方法，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估模型真实推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合System 1和System 2推理，在提高推理性能的同时显著降低计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放虽然能提升大语言模型的推理性能，但计算成本高昂。现有动态自一致性方法受限于串行请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速的System 1计算查询的答案熵，评估样本的缩放潜力，在System 2下实现动态自一致性，通过并行生成降低延迟。

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了47%的token消耗减少和43%的推理延迟降低，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC框架通过System 1和System 2的协同工作，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率和速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，这是一个轻量级的、不依赖本体的SPARQL到Cypher查询转换器，在多个数据集上显著提升了解析准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SPARQL到Cypher转换解决方案存在解析错误率高的问题，需要开发一个更准确、轻量级的转换工具。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询。

Result: 在Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite的总解析准确率达到77.8%，相比最先进的S2CTrans的44.2%有显著提升；在执行准确率方面达到96.6%，优于S2CTrans 7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个有效的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，显著提升了转换准确率，并生成了统一的Text-to-Query数据集Spider4SSC，为多语言查询转换研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在输出评估方面越来越有效，但尚不清楚这种能力是否能扩展到更一般的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础大语言模型，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分对齐。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估表明，所提模型性能有所改进，且这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架在多语言文本质量评估方面表现优异，并能有效提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 自我纠正机制的设计应考虑任务结构和输出空间的相互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向的LLM应用都有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出AMaPO方法解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，通过自适应边距动态调整学习力度，提升排序准确性和下游对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法在排序准确性上存在局限，主要面临过拟合-欠拟合困境：正确排序样本梯度浪费，错误排序样本纠正信号不足。

Method: AMaPO采用实例级自适应边距，通过Z归一化和指数缩放动态重新分配学习力度，放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确排序样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO实现了更好的排序准确性和优越的下游对齐性能，有效缓解了过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计成功解决了离线偏好优化中的核心困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Motivation: 当前商业多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未达到同等水平，需要为巴斯克语开发强大的多模态模型。

Method: 构建训练和评估用的图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配的Latxa作为骨干模型，探索不同数据混合比例进行训练。

Result: 仅需约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准测试中获得良好结果，且使用巴斯克语指令调优的骨干模型并非必需。

Conclusion: 为其他低资源语言开发多模态大语言模型提供了可行路径，通过公开释放资源促进相关研究。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Conclusion: CARE-Bench为开发更全面、通用和有效的咨询模型提供了方向，有助于提升大语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 机器学习研究发展迅速，从科学出版物中提取信息能够大规模识别研究概念和资源，有助于提高对ML相关研究的理解和可复现性。需要细粒度数据集来提取和连接ML研究中的详细信息，如方法训练和数据使用。

Method: 构建了GSAP-ERE数据集，包含从100篇ML出版物全文手工标注的63K实体和35K关系。使用该数据集微调模型进行信息提取，并与大型语言模型的提示策略进行比较。

Result: 微调模型在命名实体识别和关系提取任务上表现优异（NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0%），而最先进的大型语言模型提示方法性能较差（NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%）。数据集支持知识图谱构建和研究可复现性监控等下游任务。

Conclusion: 监督模型与无监督使用大型语言模型之间存在显著的性能差距，表明需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推进学术信息提取领域的研究。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Conclusion: TPoT策略是一种简单有效的文本预选方法，能够提升人格特质预测性能并解决输入文本限制问题。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于神经符号距离场曲率正则化的有限差分框架，用轻量级有限差分模板替代昂贵的二阶自动微分，在保持重建质量的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用二阶自动微分来强制曲率先验，虽然准确但计算成本高昂；其他方法避免显式Hessian组装但仍需高阶微分，计算开销仍然很大。

Method: 使用基于泰勒展开的有限差分模板来近似二阶导数，截断误差为O(h^2)，可作为高斯曲率和秩亏损失的直接替代方案。

Result: 实验表明有限差分变体实现了与自动微分对应方法相当的重建保真度，同时将GPU内存使用和训练时间减少高达两倍。在稀疏、不完整和非CAD数据上的测试也证实了方法的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出的有限差分公式为曲率感知SDF学习提供了一个高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了真实表面光源在自由曲面透镜设计中的表示问题，为复杂光照模式的光学设计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Designing freeform surfaces to control light based on real-world illumination patterns is challenging, as existing caustic lens designs often assume oversimplified point or parallel light sources. We propose representing surface light sources using an optimized set of point sources, whose parameters are fitted to the real light source's illumination using a novel differentiable rendering framework. Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability. Simulations and physical experiments show our method more accurately represents real surface light sources compared to point-source approximations, yielding caustic lenses that produce images closely matching the target light distributions.

### [124] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将英文翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题求解工具，但需要学习语法。随着非编程人员需要与代码交互的需求增加，需要一种将自然语言转换为ASP程序的方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，相比完全依赖LLM的方法，本系统最小化了LLM的作用。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题求解系统的第一步重要进展。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于向量符号代数的认知合理ARC-AGI求解器，结合系统1直觉和系统2推理，在ARC-AGI基准测试中取得初步成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然人类能轻松解决ARC-AGI问题，但现有AI系统仍难以应对。受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法的启发，希望开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用神经符号方法，基于向量符号代数整合系统1直觉和系统2推理。通过面向对象的程序合成，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%。在更简单的基准测试中表现优异：Sort-of-ARC得分94.5%，1D-ARC得分83.1%（以极低计算成本超越GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，为人工通用智能提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

### [126] [Interpretable by Design: Query-Specific Neural Modules for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08749)
*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QDIN是一种将强化学习系统设计为可查询推理引擎的统一架构，通过专门的神经模块处理不同类型的查询（策略、可达性、路径、比较），在推理准确性和控制性能之间发现了根本性的解耦现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统强化学习单一目标优化的范式，探索将RL系统构建为能够回答环境多样化查询的推理引擎，充分利用训练后智能体隐含的环境知识。

Method: 引入查询条件确定性推理网络(QDIN)，为不同类型的查询设计专门的神经模块，将策略、可达性、路径和比较等查询作为一等公民处理。

Result: 发现推理准确性与控制性能的根本解耦：推理准确率可达近乎完美水平（99%可达性IoU），而控制性能仍处于次优状态（31%回报）。专门化架构在推理任务上优于统一模型和后验提取方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从设计之初就将RL系统构建为可查询知识库的研究议程奠定了基础，对可解释性、验证和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [127] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用神经网络表示POMDP值函数的新方法——神经价值迭代，解决了传统方法在大规模POMDP中计算成本过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POMDP求解器使用α向量表示值函数，但在大规模问题中计算成本过高，因为每个α向量都是|S|维的，Bellman备份变得难以处理。

Method: 利用PWLC特性，将POMDP值函数表示为有限个神经网络的集合，结合神经网络的泛化能力和经典价值迭代框架，提出神经价值迭代算法。

Result: 该方法在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP中仍能获得接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为大规模POMDP规划提供了可行的替代方案，结合了神经网络的泛化优势和传统价值迭代的框架。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

### [128] [UCO: A Multi-Turn Interactive Reinforcement Learning Method for Adaptive Teaching with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08873)
*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了单向认知优化（UCO）方法，通过多轮交互强化学习解决LLM作为智能导师的两个关键挑战：无法区分学生真实理解与答案回显，以及无法动态感知学生认知状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前监督微调方法只学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力。现有强化学习方法仅基于学生答案正确性评估教学效果，无法感知学生真实认知状态变化。

Method: UCO采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进步奖励捕捉学生认知进步，支架奖励动态识别学生最近发展区（ZPD）。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法有效解决了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应问题，通过认知状态感知和最近发展区识别实现了更有效的教学策略调整。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: Lumine展示了在开放环境中通用智能体的有效性，能够适应不同世界和交互动态，是迈向通用智能体的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

TL;DR: 本文批判当前生物声学AI系统忽视AI递归认知与物种递归通信的相遇问题，提出需要从通用模式识别转向不同递归认知形式的外交式相遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统虽然跨物种表现优异，但忽视了AI自身递归认知过程可能系统性地模糊或扭曲其他物种的通信结构，存在双重偶然性问题。

Method: 基于哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的研究，分析AI系统作为递归认知代理的本质，提出重新概念化生物声学AI的方法论框架。

Result: 识别出AI系统与物种通信之间的双重偶然性问题：物种通信源于生态和进化条件，而AI通过自身架构和训练条件处理这些信号。

Conclusion: 解决这一挑战需要将生物声学AI重新概念化为不同递归认知形式之间的外交式相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法都有重要影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 自动化预测准备，构建多源认知基础；2) 生成式推理和反思优化，集成统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环进行持续自校正。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时序预测的准确性和实用性，为复杂现实环境提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于图神经网络(GNN)的方法来近似计算ABA框架中的可信接受性，通过依赖图表示和两种GNN架构(ABAGCN和ABAGAT)实现了比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设的论证(ABA)是一种强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算扩展对于大型框架是难解的，需要高效的近似方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，使用异构边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系；提出了两种GNN架构ABAGCN和ABAGAT，分别使用残差异构卷积层和注意力层来学习节点嵌入。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA 2023基准测试中优于最先进的GNN基线，节点级F1得分高达0.71；扩展重构算法在小框架上F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径，证明了GNN在ABA框架近似计算中的有效性。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出卓越的流畅性，但研究人员仍在努力从中提取更强的推理能力。本文基于搜索视角理解LLM计算，旨在通过结构化多智能体管道来增强推理能力。

Method: 采用递归精炼方法，包括自我批评、对抗性压力测试和整合关键反馈的迭代过程。设计了简单线性管道与复杂结构化管道的对比实验，使用基于RAG的美国开国元勋历史人物模型来回应当代政治问题。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理能力的稳健架构特征，验证了高质量推理是受控的增量搜索这一框架。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Conclusion: 相比持续改进当前LLMs，大规模分解代理过程(MDAPs)可能为解决组织和社会级别问题提供有效途径。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统在部署到公共道路上时，会面临各种驾驶危险，可能危及安全并降低系统性能，因此需要具备持续监控危险和自适应响应潜在安全违规的能力。

Method: Argus框架持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。该框架与三种先进的端到端ADS（TCP、UniAD和VAD）集成。

Conclusion: Argus框架能够有效且高效地增强自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著改善驾驶性能并预防安全违规。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

*Zezhen Ding,Zhen Tan,Jiheng Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化两阶段设计，仅需1/10的数据量就能达到67.7%的平均求解准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的优化问题自动化方法需要大量标注或合成数据，成本高且可扩展性差，需要开发数据效率更高的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先通过监督微调从有限标注数据中学习问题建模和代码生成的推理模式，然后通过测试时组相对策略优化提升能力和一致性。

Result: OR-R1在仅使用ORLM所需1/10合成数据的情况下，平均求解准确率达到67.7%，比ORLM高出4.2%。仅用100个合成样本就超过ORLM 2.4%以上。TGRPO带来额外3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出历史感知推理框架HAR，解决GUI代理在长时程任务中短期记忆弱的问题，通过反思学习增强历史交互感知能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在显式推理中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散屏幕理解，缺乏对历史交互的感知，这限制了GUI自动化的性能

Method: 构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南、设计混合RL奖励函数，开发端到端模型HAR-GUI-3B，将推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试上的综合评估证明了方法的有效性和泛化能力

Conclusion: HAR框架成功增强了GUI代理的短期记忆和屏幕细节感知能力，提升了长时程GUI任务的执行性能

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProBench是一个针对移动GUI代理的综合基准测试，包含200多个挑战性任务，通过引入过程相关任务和专门的评估方法来解决现有基准仅关注最终状态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理基准主要基于最终屏幕状态评估任务完成情况，但GUI操作任务包含多个链式步骤，且关键信息不一定呈现在最后几页中。虽然已有研究开始考虑中间步骤，但准确自动捕获过程信息仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出ProBench基准，保留传统的状态相关任务评估，扩展数据集包含过程相关任务，并设计专门的评估方法。引入过程提供器自动提供准确的过程信息，实现精确的代理性能评估。

Result: 对先进GUI代理的评估揭示了在真实世界GUI场景中的显著局限性。这些缺陷在多样化模型中普遍存在，包括大规模通用模型和较小的GUI专用模型。

Conclusion: 详细的错误分析揭示了几个普遍问题，为未来改进指明了具体方向。ProBench为GUI代理的全面评估提供了新标准。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的管道，通过新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)解决大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在减少响应长度的同时提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1经常生成包含冗余推理步骤的冗长响应(过度思考现象)，显著增加计算成本。现有方法通过长度惩罚存在长度崩溃和训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的管道，并引入简洁性奖励函数(CRF)，明确建立结果奖励与简洁性分数之间的依赖关系，促进更有效和高效的推理。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应长度减少，且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLM上泛化良好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简洁性奖励模型有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时显著减少了计算成本，具有理论优越性和实践有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能AI系统虽然具有自主性优势，但在高风险领域可靠性不足，需要缓解技术来应对操作中的意外行为风险。

Method: 基于智能AI系统特性推导主要可靠性挑战，提出包含离群检测层（处理新输入）和AI透明度层（揭示内部操作）的双层监控框架。

Result: 该框架为人类操作员提供决策支持，帮助判断输出是否可能不可靠并介入干预。

Conclusion: 该监控框架为开发缓解技术奠定了基础，可降低操作中可靠性不确定性带来的风险。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedFuse框架，通过乘法融合模块处理不规则临床时间序列数据，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列数据具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等问题。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实数据集（重症监护和慢性护理）上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

TL;DR: 提出HyperD框架，通过解耦交通数据的周期性和残差分量来提升交通预测精度，解决了空间依赖性和多尺度周期模式的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临复杂空间依赖性和多尺度周期模式与不规则波动的共存挑战，需要有效分离周期性模式和异常波动。

Method: 使用Hybrid Periodic Decoupling框架，将数据解耦为周期性和残差分量，分别用混合周期表示模块和频率感知残差表示模块处理，并引入双视图对齐损失确保语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，在干扰下具有更好的鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过有效解耦周期性和非周期性模式，显著提升了交通预测性能，为智能交通系统提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了从"模型训练"到"模型培养"的范式转变，将价值观对齐从模型开发之初就融入其中，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现早期价值观承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易被误导且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类能力的生态系统中，这成为一个关键需求。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：从第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、以及搭建训练数据的顺序框架。

Result: 预期这种训练语料库的重新设计将导致从第一个训练标记开始的早期价值观承诺，使得知识、技能和价值观在本质上更难分离。

Conclusion: 需要从模型开发之初就将价值观对齐融入其中，通过"模型培养"而非"模型训练"的方式，确保AI系统具有深层次的价值体系。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Method: 引入基于LLM的智能体框架，使用自然语言推理来提出、改进和验证候选证书，集成LLM驱动的模板发现与SMT验证，支持屏障-控制器协同合成。

Result: 在BarrierBench基准测试中，该框架在生成有效证书方面达到超过90%的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过发布BarrierBench和配套工具链，旨在建立社区测试平台，推进语言推理与形式验证在动力学系统中的集成。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL领域解决任务的能力与LAMA规划器相当；在混淆测试中所有LLM性能下降但下降程度小于之前报告的模型，显示相比前代LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上相比前代模型有实质性改进，缩小了与专业规划器在挑战性基准测试中的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创造性领域中的程序能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令基础、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突显了表面理解与真实创造性领域中可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法通过单独检查检测到，需要一种架构无关的补充方法。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，选择最安全的s个模型子集，当模型间达成足够共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法利用模型计算输出概率的能力。

Result: 该算法能够实现与最安全s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，并在安全模型足够多且共识充分时限制弃权概率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关的AI安全途径，通过从模型集合中未知的安全子集放大安全保证到单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而Physical AI将智能理解为身体、环境和经验之间真实交互的涌现现象，需要建立新的理论基础。

Method: 提出了六个基本原则：具身化、感官感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原则构成一个封闭的控制循环，能量、信息、控制和情境在其中持续交互。

Result: 建立了物理AI的理论框架，通过康复诊所中的自适应辅助机器人案例展示了六个基本原则在实际系统中的相互作用。

Conclusion: 物理AI将智能理解为物理具身过程，学习不是参数调整而是智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，这种范式转变使系统能够从物理经验而非数据库中生成意义。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.
