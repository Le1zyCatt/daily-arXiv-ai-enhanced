Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的分层运动建模方法，通过图学习直接从数据中学习结构化和可解释的运动关系，将全局绝对运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义或启发式的固定运动基元层次结构，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能够直接从数据中学习运动层次结构的通用方法。

Method: 将层次推断构建为可微分的图学习问题，使用顶点表示基本运动，通过图神经网络学习有向边捕获的父子依赖关系。

Result: 在1D平移运动、2D旋转运动和3D高斯溅射场景变形三个案例中，该方法成功重建了内在运动层次结构，相比基线产生了更真实和可解释的变形。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适用于广泛运动中心任务的可适应、数据驱动的分层建模范式。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

### [3] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件修复模型，从随意视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频脆弱。warp-then-inpaint方法虽然无需姿态标签，但将相机运动与场景动态耦合，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机库替代显式轨迹预测。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过时空自回归推理管道在虚拟相机样条上生成连贯视频。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法。

Conclusion: SEE4D实现了从随意视频进行实用4D世界建模的进展，通过分离相机控制与场景建模，实现了更好的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [4] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下目标检测的有效性，开发了T-YOLOv5及其增强版本T-YOLOv5 with CBAM，在动态海洋环境中显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，包括突然运动、部分遮挡和渐进运动等复杂条件，探索时空建模和注意力机制如何提升检测可靠性。

Method: 第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能对比；第二阶段开发了集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本，通过比较三个模型的性能来验证时空建模和注意力机制的有效性。

Result: 测试结果显示，YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5 with CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂目标检测中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提升了检测可靠性，而T-YOLOv5 with CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步改善性能，但在简单场景下存在精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [5] [OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800)
*Yukun Huang,Jiwen Yu,Yanning Zhou,Jianan Wang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX是一个基于全景感知的统一框架，通过重用2D生成先验来创建适用于物理渲染的图形就绪3D场景，包括几何、纹理和PBR材质的感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D提升方法主要关注外观生成而忽略内在属性感知，需要开发能够生成适用于物理渲染、重光照和仿真的图形就绪3D场景的技术。

Method: 提出OmniX框架，采用轻量高效的跨模态适配器结构，重用2D生成先验进行全景感知、生成和补全；构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Result: 实验证明模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面有效，为沉浸式和物理真实虚拟世界生成开辟新可能性。

Conclusion: OmniX通过重用2D生成先验成功实现了图形就绪3D场景的生成，推动了全景技术在物理真实虚拟环境创建中的应用。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

### [6] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间直接对多个奖励模型进行条件化，让模型直接学习用户偏好，从而避免了后处理选择带来的数据浪费，显著提升了生成图像的视觉质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练，以实现多样化的生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过后处理选择生成的图像来对齐奖励，但这种方式会丢弃信息数据，损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间直接对多个奖励模型进行条件化，让模型直接学习用户偏好，而不是采用后处理方式。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，不仅显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量，还大大加快了训练速度。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间直接条件化多个奖励模型来学习用户偏好，比后处理选择方法更有效，能够同时保持多样性和语义保真度，并提高训练效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [7] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了针对自行车安全的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过领域特定训练显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电动自行车日益普及导致骑行者脆弱性增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台，开发并评估针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集，包含29个动态和静态类别的语义标注。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后，平均交并比(mIoU)达到63.6%，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为推进以骑行者为中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [8] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练模型，能够有效修复图像并实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能够有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现图像采集时间2-4倍的减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [9] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的免反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、独立计算子流并自适应聚合，解决了现有流模型在图像编辑中的反演不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在反演过程不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑结果无法忠实反映目标提示词。现有免反演方法编辑质量仍不理想。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架：1）语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示词；2）为每个子提示词计算独立流；3）设计投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解缠方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了图像编辑中的反演和梯度纠缠问题，在保持多样性的同时确保编辑结果的一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [10] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT：一种基于大脑功能集群交互的fMRI图像重建方法，通过Brain Interaction Transformer实现大脑体素集群与局部图像特征的直接信息流动，显著提升重建图像的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法在忠实度方面存在不足，需要更有效的大脑信息整合机制来准确重建被试看到的图像。

Method: 提出Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT)，通过功能相似的大脑体素集群交互，预测高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征来指导扩散模型，实现大脑信息到图像特征的直接映射。

Result: 方法在视觉和客观指标上均超越现有SotA方法，仅需1小时fMRI数据即可达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过大脑功能集群的交互机制，实现了更忠实的fMRI图像重建，显著减少了数据需求，为脑机接口应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛，在数据稀缺条件下开发实时MRI肿瘤跟踪方法，最终采用基于SAM 2.1基础模型的分割方案，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在胸腹部cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下，探索有效的肿瘤定位方法。

Method: 探索了两种互补策略：无监督配准和基于SAM 2.1基础模型的分割。最终选择SAM 2.1 b+模型，使用第一帧标注切片作为mask提示，仅在TrackRAD2025小标注子集上微调，采用1024x1024补丁、标准数据增强和平衡Dice+IoU损失函数。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice相似系数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第6位，满足1秒运行时间约束。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放射治疗中具有强大的实时肿瘤跟踪潜力，能够在数据稀缺条件下实现准确分割。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hilbert选择性扫描机制的Mamba框架增强方法，通过提高扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来更有效地探索特征空间，改善低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在特征空间探索方面存在局限，无法充分捕捉精细尺度的细节信息，存在信息不一致性问题，需要改进扫描机制以提升性能。

Method: 引入Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，更有效地探索特征空间，同时保持处理长程依赖关系的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了现有基于Mamba的低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该策略不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术，还为更广泛的应用基于Mamba技术的领域带来了希望。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测仅限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类能够自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: 构建CAVE基准数据集，包含细粒度标注，涵盖异常的可视化定位、视觉表现分类、复杂性、严重性和常见性等维度，基于认知科学研究设计评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进视觉语言模型在异常检测和常识推理方面的研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时间注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限性，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时间注意力模块，通过时间注意力机制使模型在将视觉标记传递给LLM之前更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试上性能提升高达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过在视觉编码器中增强时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

TL;DR: FlexICL是一种新颖的上下文学习框架，用于超声图像中的骨骼区域分割，仅需5%的训练图像即可在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上实现鲁棒分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声图像分割中像素级专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，为轻度训练的用户提供实时反馈和关键结构突出显示。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用图像拼接技术和训练策略进行视觉上下文学习，在视频内分割设置中，专家仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见帧。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描中，FlexICL比Painter、MAE-VQGAN等最先进视觉ICL模型以及U-Net、TransUNet等传统分割模型的Dice系数高出1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL作为超声图像分割的高效可扩展解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学成像用例。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，在扩散模型的去噪过程中自适应生成负提示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定提示，无法根据生成过程中的图像内容进行动态调整

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡关系

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法能够根据生成过程自适应调整，优于传统的固定负提示方法

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是在图像编辑应用中构成新的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型在文本和图像模态之间的对齐不足，存在生成不当或NSFW内容的风险，而现有攻击方法主要关注生成对抗性提示词。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)，通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，而不修改提示词本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵各种模型的输出内容。

Conclusion: PReMA揭示了多模态扩散模型在仅通过图像输入进行操纵时的新安全漏洞，对图像编辑应用构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: 研究视频LLM在捕捉同一事件的不同视角视频时，能否保持时间理解的一致性。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和他者视角视频对，提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角一致性。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性方面表现较差，View-GRPO方法相比传统SFT和GRPO在提升一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多步骤解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条释文的领域专用多模态知识库，开发集成多种甲骨文分析工具的智能体系统，利用大语言模型灵活编排这些组件。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务上表现优异，超越主流MLLMs如GPT-4o。案例研究显示能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent为实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统的实际部署迈出了重要一步，展示了在文化遗产保护领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会带来计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，然后使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在长尾场景中的真实潜力，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建了包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的WOD-E2E数据集，专门针对发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景，并提出了基于评分者偏好标签的RFS评估指标。

Result: WOD-E2E数据集提供了高级路由信息、自车状态和8个环绕摄像头的360度视图，并发布了验证集的所有评分者偏好标签。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界情况。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM中的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型在多个领域取得显著进展，但将基于梯度的注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。这种集成对于视觉任务如SLAM特别有益，因为CNN表示中融入空间注意力对象位置可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的层间注意力信息与CNN特征表示相集成，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 通过集成基于梯度的注意力信息与CNN特征表示，可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，尤其是在复杂环境中。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏几何细节，而显式体素表示中共享全局网格导致小部件占据过少体素而质量下降。

Method: 首先通过隐式边界框向量集扩散过程生成边界框布局，然后在每个部件的固定全分辨率体素网格中生成详细部件，并引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，有效解决了3D部件生成中的细节保留和尺寸差异问题，并发布了最大的PartVerse-XL数据集来推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM是一个针对多模态多轮对话的全面RAG基准测试，包含6.5K个(图像、问题、答案)三元组和2K个基于视觉的多轮对话，覆盖13个领域，特别关注可穿戴设备场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补多模态检索增强生成在可穿戴设备场景下缺乏全面基准测试的空白，支持智能眼镜等设备的信息查询需求。

Method: 构建包含6.2K个以自我为中心图像的多样化数据集，设计了五种图像质量问题、六种问题类型，并创建了三个任务：单源增强、多源增强和多轮对话。

Result: 现有RAG方法在单轮和多轮QA上的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，行业最优解决方案也仅有32%/45%，表明有巨大改进空间。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试已成功应用于KDD Cup 2025竞赛，吸引了大量参与者，获胜方案将基线性能提升了28%，对推动该领域发展具有重要影响。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Result: 实验表明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中能够超越最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，用于通过稀疏自编码器分析视觉数据集中的概念偏见，无需精细标注即可发现和量化人类可解释的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据集偏见，但系统识别这些偏见需要昂贵的细粒度属性标注，因此需要开发无需标注的自动偏见检测方法。

Method: 使用在视觉基础模型表示上训练的稀疏自编码器，将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型，基于语义相关性和与类别标签的统计相关性进行分析。

Result: ConceptScope能够捕捉广泛的视觉概念，包括物体、纹理、背景、面部属性、情感和动作，并能检测已知偏见（如Waterbirds中的背景偏见）和发现未标注偏见（如ImageNet中的共现物体）。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够可靠地识别数据集偏见并支持基于概念的子分组进行鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Conclusion: 提出的"从合成中学习"策略和数据驱动框架有效解决了素描到3D人体姿态估计的挑战，在精度和效率方面实现了显著提升。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Method: 使用混合卷积和几何深度学习的新型几何深度网络，提出切比雪夫集成几何网络(Ch-EGN)，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Result: 在DataCo数据集上风险管理的平均准确率达98.95%；在SupplyGraph数据集上，5类产品分类准确率100%，4类产品关系分类准确率98.07%，25类公司关系分类准确率92.37%。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和现有方法在复杂领域表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究过度依赖学术论文的Manhattan式结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型严重不足。

Method: 构建了首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，涵盖6种常见文档类型。提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用0.5B参数的两阶段粗到细学习范式：1）从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，2）将知识迁移到特定领域进行细粒度标注。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家方法和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的数据稀缺和复杂领域布局生成问题，为文档布局生成研究提供了重要基础。代码、模型和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了现代视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向（前进或倒退）方面的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，远低于人类水平，揭示了当前多模态系统在时间连续性和因果理解方面的根本缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但它们在视频中处理时间信息的能力较弱且评估不足。作者旨在通过判断时间方向这一简单但具有揭示性的挑战来探索这一差距。

Method: 引入了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准测试，使用与人类行为基线相同的刺激材料，评估开放权重和专有、推理和非推理的视觉语言模型在自然视频中推断时间方向的能力。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）上的表现接近随机水平，即使最佳模型也远远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。作者发布代码和数据以促进视觉语言模型在物理和时间推理能力方面的进一步发展。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法能够有效提升红外与可见光图像融合的结构一致性和细节质量，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Method: 在VGGFace2的眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构，使用余弦和chi2距离度量，进行分数级逻辑回归融合，并通过LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度分析注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合带来显著性能提升。热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，解释了它们的互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上显著优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在眼周验证中具有互补性，网络融合策略能够显著提升性能，实现新的最优结果。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CATG框架通过约束流匹配有效解决了模式坍塌问题，能够生成多样化且符合约束的轨迹，同时允许对轨迹风格进行精确控制。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼周区域具有高区分性和最小采集约束，但现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集进行训练，本研究旨在利用大规模数据集评估CNN架构的有效性。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在VGGFace2数据库的1,907,572个眼部裁剪图像上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在不受控的VGGFace2条件下，眼周识别的等错误率为9-15%，而全脸图像的等错误率为3-6%。在UFPR-Periocular数据集上获得1-2%的等错误率，这是该数据集迄今报告的最低错误率。

Conclusion: 眼周生物识别在高质量图像和一致采集协议下表现优异，但在不受控条件下性能下降。大规模训练数据有助于提升识别性能，UFPR-Periocular数据集上的结果达到当前最佳水平。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于证据理论融合CNN和ViT特征的新方法，用于糖尿病视网膜病变分级诊断，提高了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一CNN或ViT的糖尿病视网膜病变诊断方法性能已达瓶颈，需要融合两种架构的优势：CNN的局部特征提取能力和ViT的全局特征捕获能力。

Method: 通过深度证据网络将不同骨干网络的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见，自适应调整融合模式，实现CNN和ViT的有效融合。

Result: 在两个公开糖尿病视网膜病变分级数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅提高了分级准确性，还提供了优秀的特征融合和决策可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于证据理论的融合范式能有效结合CNN和ViT的优势，提升糖尿病视网膜病变诊断性能，同时增强模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [42] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门优化图像超分辨率中的文本可读性和感知质量，通过TS-ControlNet和乒乓调度器在文本和场景指导间交替，显著提升OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真度或感知指标，但对字符级错误不敏感，导致场景文本（如标志、标签等）的可读性差，影响OCR和下游应用。

Method: 使用文本-SR融合控制网络(TS-ControlNet)和乒乓调度器，在合成语料上训练文本恢复组件，同时保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，GLYPH-SR在x4和x8倍率下将OCR F1分数提升高达15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的感知质量指标。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又能正确阅读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EEG驱动图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，限制了保真度和语义连贯性。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征，通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1对齐神经信号与视觉语义，同时使用ControlNet分支基于显著图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，相比现有方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著提升，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG模糊性问题，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含现实复杂提示和多维度评估框架，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要依赖简化提示和低层次指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，特别是在处理长视频和复杂提示时存在评估挑战。

Method: 基于真实视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示集，建立多维度评估框架，包括新提出的事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和人类期望实现度（HERD）等指标。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型的评估显示，当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长视频复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指出了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征间的最小成对角度距离来实现归一化文本特征的均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散度或施加正交约束，但可能无法实现类间文本特征的最佳角度分离，忽略了角度多样性的关键作用，这会影响模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。

Method: A-TPT框架通过最大化归一化文本特征在单位超球面上的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性，从而提高角度多样性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在减少聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性，在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应关系能力，将其扩展应用于动态点跟踪任务。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅使用包含查询点的帧对进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 通过3D基础对应关系和动态对应训练，基础3D重建模型可以成功适配为有效的点跟踪器，在静态和动态点跟踪任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MFSC方法为异常检测数据集提供多层级细粒度文本描述，并设计了FineGrainedAD框架来提升异常定位性能，包含多层级可学习提示和多层级语义对齐两个组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用预定义的图像级描述来匹配视觉块，导致语义错配和次优的定位性能。

Method: 提出MFSC自动构建多层级细粒度文本描述，FineGrainedAD框架包含MLLP（通过自动替换和拼接机制引入细粒度语义）和MLSA（设计区域聚合策略和多层级对齐训练）。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，FineGrainedAD在少样本设置下取得了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过提供多层级细粒度文本描述和相应的对齐机制，显著提升了异常定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时存在对象-上下文关联偏差，影响零样本预测的可靠性。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过重组对象特征与多样化替代上下文来合成反事实嵌入，使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来消除背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过头尾再平衡策略有效缓解了自改进过程中的马太效应，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知推理提供了可扩展且可解释的方法，推进了动态真实世界环境中的零样本泛化能力

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨领域适应框架，通过轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制提升VQA模型在遥感、医疗、数学图表等领域的泛化能力，无需重新训练主干模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗、数学图表等跨领域场景中泛化能力显著下降，而传统的领域特定微调方法成本高、不灵活且难以扩展。

Method: 提出域分类器识别输入图像类型，以及包含提示适配器和视觉适配器的双适配器机制，通过统一钩子接口动态注入，实现视觉和语言特征的分离适应。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA提升2.3 BLEU，MedVQA-RAD提升2.6 VQA分数，ChartQA提升3.1 ROUGE分数。

Conclusion: CATCH提供了一种可扩展和可扩展的多领域VQA方法，能够在不同应用领域中实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Conclusion: Emu3.5展示了强大的原生多模态能力，支持时空一致的世界探索和开放世界具身操作，已开源供社区研究使用。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习数据先验，在BioSR数据集上表现优异，在数据保真度和感知真实性之间达到最佳平衡，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，需要找到合适的先验来外推显微镜图像中未成像的频率。随着数据驱动的机器学习技术的发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4个不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法相比，ResMatching始终取得有竞争力的结果，在所有情况下都表现出数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡。在低分辨率图像包含大量噪声等难以学习强先验的情况下特别有效。

Conclusion: ResMatching是一种有效的计算超分辨率方法，能够学习改进的数据先验，提供校准的后验分布和像素级不确定性估计，指导用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门为事件相机设计的标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，同时实现更快的推理速度且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但失去了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特点。需要一种能保持这些独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 使用Spiking Patches标记化器将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示，并在手势识别和物体检测任务上使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比基于体素的标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍，同时精度相当甚至在某些情况下更好（手势识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是向保持事件相机特性方法迈进的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰漂移准确估计对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要，但传统光流方法在复杂场景中精度有限，而深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域表现出色，其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度(EPE 6-8像素，300-400米)，相对于海冰运动空间尺度和北极典型导航需求误差较小，能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效迁移到极地遥感应用，提供空间连续的漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循特定指令方面存在不足，需要一种轻量级方法来引导模型输出更好地符合期望行为，同时保持原有任务性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应引导动态调整激活连接。

Result: SteerVLM仅需学习原始VLM 0.14%的参数，在引导和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了稳健解决方案，并引入了VNIA数据集来促进VLM引导技术的开发和评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个从视频生成（ViGen）向3D人体运动生成（MoGen）系统迁移知识的框架，包括大规模数据集ViMoGen-228K、基于流匹配的扩散变换器ViMoGen及其轻量版ViMoGen-light，以及分层评估基准MBench。

Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型在泛化能力上存在瓶颈，而视频生成领域已展现出卓越的人类行为建模泛化能力，这为运动生成提供了可迁移的见解。

Method: 1）构建ViMoGen-228K数据集，整合高质量光学动捕数据、网络视频语义标注动作和ViGen模型生成样本；2）提出基于流匹配的扩散变换器ViMoGen，通过门控多模态条件统一MoCap数据和ViGen模型的先验；3）开发轻量版ViMoGen-light，消除视频生成依赖但保持强泛化；4）建立分层评估基准MBench。

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成向运动生成迁移知识，该框架有效解决了3D人体运动生成的泛化瓶颈问题，为未来研究提供了数据、模型和评估基准支持。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出一种混合方法实现大尺度细粒度地理定位，通过代理分类任务学习丰富特征表示，结合航拍图像嵌入提高鲁棒性，在欧洲数据集上68%查询可在200米内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像精确定位问题，传统图像检索方法在大规模数据下效率低且覆盖不足，现有方案存在粗粒度定位或小区域限制的缺陷。

Method: 使用代理分类任务训练学习隐含精确位置信息的特征表示，结合地面和航拍图像的嵌入表示，提高对稀疏地面数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，68%以上的查询可以在200米范围内实现精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在大地理范围内实现了细粒度地理定位，解决了传统方法的效率和覆盖问题，代码已公开。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

### [69] [Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799)
*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在图像字幕任务中训练视觉编码器，无需辅助目标即可获得有竞争力的视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号的强度依赖于标记在序列中的位置，需要辅助目标来增强学习效果。MDC旨在消除这种位置依赖性，提供更均匀的视觉学习信号。

Method: 在训练过程中，随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，然后训练基于视觉特征的解码器重构原始文本。使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型来学习视觉特征。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，MDC学习的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MDC提供了一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，无需依赖序列位置或辅助目标，在多个下游视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究对视频生成模型Veo-3在视觉推理任务中的表现进行了全面评估，发现其在短时空间一致性和局部动态推理方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在复杂视觉推理场景中使用，特别是研究其视觉感知、建模和操作能力。

Method: 通过MME-CoF基准测试对Veo-3模型在12个维度上进行系统性评估，包括空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等方面。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了StreetMath基准来评估LLM在现实近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLM倾向于精确计算而非近似推理，且近似与精确算术依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算上的表现，但在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型方面。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，评估多种LLM架构（Qwen3-4B、Dream-v0、Falcon-Mamba、Mamba-GPT），并应用机制可解释性技术探究其内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在需要近似的任务中仍倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具；近似与精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件；LLM未表现出人类在街头数学中的认知吝啬性。

Conclusion: LLM在近似推理方面存在局限，缺乏人类在快速数学运算中的认知效率，近似与精确计算在神经网络中具有分离性。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Motivation: 传统基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑意见的强度差异，无法区分从非常弱到非常强的不同程度的情感表达。

Method: 结合意见词（副词、形容词、名词、动词）与产品特定方面，使用模糊逻辑算法对意见词进行分类，并通过句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系。

Result: 能够对实体评论进行细粒度的强度分类，并计算实体在特定方面的得分。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地分析用户对产品不同方面的情感强度，为实体排名提供更精确的依据。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿中收集数据，构建了563,299个标注韩语句子的大规模数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习立场检测模型。

Result: 创建了LASTIST数据集，支持目标无关立场检测和历时演化立场检测等多种任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，解决了低资源语言立场检测的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA方法，在保持性能的同时实现零延迟的适配器融合，解决LLM适配器在推理时的计算开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM部署时使用任务特定适配器会产生不成比例的计算开销（高达基础模型的2.5倍），尽管适配器参数只占不到1%。

Method: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术实现零或可忽略的延迟开销。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B参数的LLM上，zFLoRA在18个任务上表现优于LoRA和全微调，在NPU和GPU平台上实现零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是高效部署多任务LLM的有效解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理延迟。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB

Motivation: 解决人类专家在多个竞争目标下从大量选项中选择最佳选项时的困难，特别是难以形式化复杂隐式偏好的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为零样本偏好预测器，提出LISTEN-U（基于参数化效用函数）和LISTEN-T（基于非参数化锦标赛选择）两种迭代算法。

Conclusion: 这项工作探索了用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，减轻了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据中大部分缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，仅使用局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异来测量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，识别那些长距离依赖至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，并在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架能够有效筛选适合长上下文预训练的数据，显著提升模型在长文本任务上的性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在内容审核系统中角色设定对公平性和中立性的影响，确保AI系统的公正性。

Method: 通过不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态的实验，分析角色设定对有害内容分类的影响，并进行一致性分析和政治倾向任务测试。

Result: 角色设定虽不明显影响总体分类准确率，但不同意识形态的角色在有害内容判定上存在显著差异，模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致。

Conclusion: 角色设定会在大语言模型输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，这对伪装中立的AI系统使用提出了警示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床文档以base64编码附件形式存储，使得语义问答变得困难，传统向量数据库方法常常错过细微的临床关系。

Method: 开发了临床笔记QA评估平台，验证CLEAR方法对比零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成方法。测试了12个临床笔记，范围从10,000到65,000个token。

Result: CLEAR实现了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理少用了78%的token。在超过65,000个token的长文档上表现最佳，胜率达到75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中同时提高了效率和准确性，评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By

Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中具有潜力，但对其在标注数据集中的性能和影响缺乏全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 通过比较手动、自动和半自动三种标注设置，评估标注时间、覆盖度和多样性。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了框架多样性并保持相似的标注覆盖度，而纯自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在FrameNet语义标注中表现最优，平衡了效率和质量。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个代理式管道，通过反馈驱动循环从LLM中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括检测和绕过对齐拒绝的模块，在EchoTrace基准测试中显著提升了提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大语言模型的训练数据时，需要一种方法来确认模型是否见过特定内容，最有力的证据是模型能够自由重现目标内容。

Method: 采用反馈驱动循环：初步提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，对比参考段落识别差异，生成最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成，并包含检测和绕过对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升，GPT-4.1提取受版权保护文本的ROUGE-L得分从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱机制显著提升了数据提取效果。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言预训练中的常见假设，发现在1.1B和3B参数规模下，增加训练语言数量不会导致"多语言诅咒"，英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处，且适当平衡的多语言数据能提升模型能力而不损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间潜在权衡的争议。

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLMs，使用不同多语言语料库，语言数量从25到400种变化，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用。

Result: 英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任一组的语言内性能；英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处；未观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源设置下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译中的文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，即使使用现代大语言模型也会出现此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保存的影响，因为现有研究主要关注情感保存，而忽视了文化差异导致的标签漂移问题。

Method: 通过跨文化敏感领域和中性领域的实验，比较不同机器翻译系统（包括统计机器翻译和大语言模型）在文化相似和不相似语言对中的表现。

Result: 发现：(1) 机器翻译系统会导致标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2) 大语言模型编码了文化知识，利用这些知识会放大标签漂移；(3) 源语言和目标语言的文化相似性是标签保存的关键因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会损害标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提升LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成方法缺乏确定性验证机制，导致不可靠的算术解。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号引擎实现确定性验证。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，且更节省token。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理基于确定性符号引擎，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能矩阵乘法内核，通过核融合和缓存策略优化，在LLM推理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium加速器虽然为AI工作负载提供了成本效益和高性能解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性，特别是在LLM推理中的矩阵乘法关键计算内核。

Method: 基于核融合和新型缓存策略，设计了一系列针对Trainium优化的技术，包括减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动、最大化SRAM带宽、避免昂贵的矩阵转置。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，相比AWS实现的最先进矩阵乘法，在矩阵乘法内核级别平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 提出的优化技术能有效提升Trainium加速器在LLM推理中的矩阵乘法性能，显著优于现有实现。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来加速LLM推理的prefill阶段，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2x和1.6x的端到端加速，注意力计算速度分别提升2x和3x。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的分类、问答、推荐等应用仅使用LLM推理的prefill阶段，而自注意力计算因其二次复杂度成为主要性能瓶颈。研究发现语义不同的句子在不同层和头上会产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，AttnCache采用高效的缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理过程中识别并重用预缓存的相似注意力图，从而减少自注意力的计算开销。

Result: 实验结果显示，AttnCache在CPU上平均实现1.2倍端到端加速和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上平均实现1.6倍端到端加速和3倍注意力加速，准确率损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AttnCache框架通过重用相似注意力图有效加速了LLM推理的prefill阶段，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的学习困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，RLVR在正确解很少被采样时失败，而SFT容易通过逐词模仿长演示而过度拟合。

Method: SRL训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白，基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供平滑奖励，以步骤方式提供更丰富的学习信号。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强性能。SRL在代理软件工程任务中也有效泛化。

Conclusion: SRL是一个强大且多功能的面向推理的LLM训练框架，结合了监督学习和强化学习的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool是一个基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种正确的工具调用轨迹来提升模型在动态环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态数据集训练的工具使用LLM只能模仿通用的工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1)为给定查询生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力为每个步骤分配奖励；3)使用步骤级奖励计算分叉相对优势，结合轨迹相对优势来训练LLM。

Result: 在17个工具的实验环境中，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量方面相比其他训练方法有显著提升。消融研究验证了步骤级奖励的必要性和设计稳健性。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种正确轨迹的方法，有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了跨语言对齐(CLA)技术可能导致的文化擦除问题，提出了评估框架和新的推理方法来解决事实转移与文化定位之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐旨在对齐多语言表示，但可能导致文化擦除——即失去根据查询语言提供文化情境化响应的能力。作者希望系统分析这种权衡关系。

Method: 提出了转移-定位平面的评估框架来量化知识转移和文化擦除；发现了事实转移和文化特定知识在不同模型层中可最优引导；提出了Surgical Steering方法，在推理时对不同的层应用有针对性的激活引导。

Result: 重新评估了最近的CLA方法，发现在研究的六种语言中，这些方法一致地以牺牲文化定位为代价来改善事实转移；提出的Surgical Steering方法在竞争维度之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过在不同模型层分别引导事实转移和文化特定知识，可以克服当前对齐技术的局限性，在知识转移和文化定位之间取得更好的平衡。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有偶发甲状腺发现，其中92.9%为结节。这些发现与甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的更高几率相关。

Conclusion: 偶发甲状腺发现很常见，且与导致检测出小型低风险癌症的级联反应密切相关，强调了其在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用以及标准化报告和更有选择性随访的必要性。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Conclusion: 量子编程对大语言模型具有挑战性，推理模型表现优异，QCoder Benchmark为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"一题多解"（1PNS）训练范式，通过引入推理路径差异度（RPD）度量方法，选择多样化的推理路径进行训练，有效提升了语言模型在测试时扩展中的输出多样性和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的"一题一解"（1P1S）训练方式导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展（TTS）的效果。需要一种能够暴露模型于多种有效推理路径的训练方法。

Method: 提出推理路径差异度（RPD）度量方法，用于衡量多步思维链之间的语义差异；基于RPD为每个问题选择最大多样化的解决方案集，并对Qwen3-4B-Base模型进行微调。

Result: 实验显示，RPD选择的训练集产生了更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k性能，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能够进一步增强测试时扩展的有效性，通过增加推理路径的多样性来提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields

TL;DR: 利用LLM和提示工程研究说服技巧与话语关系之间的关联，通过创建银标注数据集发现六种话语关系在说服性文本中起关键作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和话语关系的数据集，需要探索这两者之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集，开发基于LLM的分类器标注PDTB 3.0二级话语关系，评估4个LLM和10种提示，创建5个银标注数据集

Result: 统计分析显示六种话语关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中起关键作用，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和表达怀疑时

Conclusion: 话语关系在说服性文本中扮演重要角色，这一发现有助于检测网络宣传和错误信息，并增进对有效沟通的理解

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MossNet，一种混合状态空间专家架构，通过MoE实现多注意力头模拟，在语言建模和下游任务中优于类似规模的transformer和SSM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制表达能力，需要更有效的多注意力头实现方案。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)架构，在通道混合MLP块和时间混合SSM核中都实现MoE，从而模拟线性多头注意力机制。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中优于类似规模的transformer和SSM架构，更大变体在万亿token训练下表现出良好的可扩展性和性能。

Conclusion: MossNet是高效、高性能循环LLM架构的有前景新方向，在移动设备和GPU上具有优越的运行速度和资源使用效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了相似性-距离-大小（SDM）语言模型，通过监督微调将预训练解码器Transformer转换为SDM模型，使用SDM激活层进行二元分类，提高指令遵循能力并减少弃权率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中存在统计效率低和弃权率高的问题，需要改进模型的校准性和生成质量。

Method: 通过监督微调预训练Transformer，使用SDM激活层进行二元分类，采用对比输入编码方案和在线生成硬负例来优化监督下一词损失。

Result: 相比强监督基线，SDM模型减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能有效提升指令遵循任务的性能，通过简单的微调即可实现更好的校准性和生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore是一个多维度框架，用于量化指令表述对LLM响应的影响，通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格来揭示传统指标未检测到的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对于实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过将基准问题系统转换为多种指令风格，并引入跨响应相似性(CRS)方法来测量风格自一致性。

Result: 在四个推理基准上的十个LLM实验显示，指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，且CRS与任务准确率强相关。确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一种原则性方法来评估指令鲁棒性，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，从而提高控制性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期的语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程。

Method: 提出TTA方法，通过为每个token分配时间步调度实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。可作为固定策略或基于任务信号的自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高20%以上，困惑度几乎减半，且仅需不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，能够识别数据集可测量的偏好和标注者实际表达的偏好，揭示人类偏好的多样性，并支持数据筛选和个性化定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测和不良的方式改变语言模型，但实践者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。现有方法难以在不预先指定假设的情况下自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器来解释反馈数据，表征数据集可测量的偏好和标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集上，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释的特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。这些特征揭示了人类偏好的广泛多样性，以及数据集级上下文的作用。

Conclusion: WIMHF为实践者提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，以更好地理解和利用偏好数据，支持有效的数据筛选和细粒度的个性化定制。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局检索增强生成（Global RAG）能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来解决现有RAG方法在全局任务上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（从少量文档中检索相关片段），但现实应用需要全局RAG能力——跨整个文档集合聚合和分析信息以获得语料库级别的洞察。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，并整合聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GlobalQA是首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准，GlobalRAG框架显著提升了全局任务的性能，为处理跨文档信息聚合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过提供语用学理论作为提示，能够有效提升语言模型在理解隐含意义任务上的表现，相比基准方法最高提升9.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含意义在人类沟通中至关重要，语言模型也应具备这种能力。现有方法在语用推理任务上表现有限，需要更有效的方法来提升模型对隐含意义的理解能力。

Method: 提出一种方法，将语用学理论（如格赖斯语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理而不呈现语用学理论的基准方法（0-shot Chain-of-Thought），本方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上的得分最高提升9.6%。在更大模型中，仅提及语用学理论名称也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，能够显著提升语言模型理解隐含意义的能力。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备识别借词的能力，这对开发少数民族语言NLP工具和语言保护有重要意义。

Method: 评估多个预训练语言模型在10种语言上区分借词和本土词的能力，使用显式指令和上下文信息。

Result: 模型在区分借词和本土词方面表现很差，证实了现代NLP系统对借词存在偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果对开发少数民族语言NLP工具和支持受主导语言词汇压力社区的语言保护具有启示意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间性能不均，模型压缩时这一问题更加严重。知识蒸馏在单语环境中表现良好，但在多语言环境中的应用研究不足。

Method: 对五种知识蒸馏方法进行控制性实证研究，在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上测试，评估跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性。

Result: 某些配置即使在模型大小减半的情况下也能保持或改善多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法发现的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有潜力，但需要仔细选择蒸馏方法以确保跨语言和跨任务的稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 提出了Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，基于神经元激活的内部信号进行无监督最佳候选选择，通过激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来提升推理性能，显著减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确响应的神经元激活更稀疏且一致性更强。

Method: NAD方法分析神经元激活模式：1）正确响应激活更少的独特神经元；2）正确响应的激活在跨样本间一致性更强。基于这些发现，使用激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来选择最佳候选。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中，NAD与多数投票性能相当；在开放式编码基准测试中，NAD持续优于Avg@64。通过早期停止，NAD减少99%的token使用，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 内部神经元信号为无监督集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，支持早期正确性预测和激进早期停止。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLMs在数字输入嵌入表示准确性与输出错误之间的冲突，探索语言模型如何处理数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Method: 创建通用探针来分析每个LLM，追踪信息（包括输出错误的原因）到特定层，研究不同LLMs的数字表示特性。

Result: 发现尽管存在表面错误，但不同语言模型学习到了可互换的、系统性的、高精度的数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中具有普遍性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs如何操作数字提供了基本理解，并指出了更精确探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出能力，但其在动态交互环境中的性能尚未充分探索，因此使用浏览器游戏作为测试场景进行评估。

Method: 使用Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world等浏览器游戏作为测试场景，以游戏内性能得分作为量化指标评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成谜题速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，往往无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: 虽然Atlas展示了强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在显著局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署的三个关键挑战：隐私问题、有限计算资源和需要教学有效响应，要求能够本地运行的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具与自反思推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或优于大型模型质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型高效模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在经济学、心理学等专业领域表现不佳的问题，这些领域需要深入的原则性理解。

Method: ACER首先生成学科目录，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对，构建综合性教材式课程，使用交错课程表进行持续预训练。

Result: 在专业MMLU子集上显著提升，微观经济学准确率提高5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，非目标领域也提升0.7点，ARC和GPQA基准提升超过2点。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法来缩小LLMs在关键领域的差距，同时防止灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

### [109] [MisSynth: Improving MISSCI Logical Fallacies Classification with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26345)
*Mykhailo Poliakov,Nadiya Shvai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MisSynth管道，通过检索增强生成合成谬误样本，用于微调大语言模型，显著提升识别科学健康相关错误信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关的错误信息非常普遍且有害，特别是当这些信息扭曲或误解科学发现时难以识别。现有标注数据有限，需要有效方法来增强模型识别能力。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)技术生成合成谬误样本，然后用这些样本微调LLM模型。在MISSCI数据集和框架上进行实验。

Result: 微调后的模型相比基线有显著提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MISSCI测试集上的F1分数绝对提升了35%以上。

Conclusion: 引入合成谬误数据可以有效增强有限标注资源，显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息分类任务中的零样本性能，即使计算资源有限也能实现。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on
https://github.com/mxpoliakov/MisSynth.

### [110] [The Geometry of Dialogue: Graphing Language Models to Reveal Synergistic Teams for Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26352)
*Kotaro Furuya,Yuichi Kitagawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互的自动团队构建框架，通过语言模型图分析模型间的语义一致性来识别协同团队，无需先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM方法虽然有望超越单模型能力，但成功关键取决于协同团队组成。由于模型不透明性，难以了解其内部特性以形成有效协作。

Method: 构建语言模型图来映射模型间关系，基于成对对话的语义一致性，然后应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型群组，反映其潜在专长。特定主题引导的对话识别出的协同团队在基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知专长的手动构建团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在科学写作中使用预训练语言模型和大语言模型进行语篇关系分类的初步调查，重点关注上下文对科学语篇关系分类任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在科学工作流程中的使用增加，需要利用语篇层面的信息来为AI生成的科学主张提供支持证据。推断科学写作中的语篇结构是实现这一目标的第一步。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型和大语言模型方法进行语篇关系分类，特别关注科学出版物这一较少研究的领域。通过实验研究上下文（定义为语篇结构）对分类任务的帮助程度。

Result: 实验表明，基于语篇结构的上下文通常对语篇关系分类任务有帮助。论文还分析了哪些科学语篇关系类型可能从上下文中获益最多。

Conclusion: 上下文在科学语篇关系分类中具有重要作用，这为使用语篇信息支持AI生成科学主张提供了基础。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniEduBench是一个全面的中文教育基准，包含24.6K高质量问答对，分为知识维度和素养维度，涵盖61个科目和11种题型。实验显示当前LLMs在教育领域仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs和基准主要关注知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的素养能力评估，且在中文语境下缺乏多样性。

Method: 构建包含24.6K问答对的综合基准，分为知识维度(18.1K)和素养维度(6.5K)，各细分为6个类别，覆盖61个科目和11种题型。

Result: 在11个主流LLMs上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率；素养维度最佳模型QWQ仍落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用面临显著挑战，特别是在素养能力方面与人类存在较大差距，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可在保持性能的同时实现50%压缩和1.63倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然语言能力出色，但部署时面临巨大的带宽和计算需求，现有压缩方法（剪枝和低秩逼近）各自表现良好但协同效应未被充分探索

Method: 将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，低秩逼近保留模型核心结构，稀疏优化去除非关键权重

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型（7B-70B）上测试，SSLC无需额外训练即超越单独方法，实现50%压缩且性能无损，至少1.63倍加速

Conclusion: SSLC为高效部署大语言模型提供了实用解决方案，通过稀疏和低秩方法的协同作用实现了压缩与性能的平衡

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了贝叶斯网络LLM融合框架(BNLF)，通过概率机制整合三个LLM的预测，用于情感分析，在三个金融语料库上实现了约6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前领域特定LLM缺乏透明度、微调成本高、需要大量提示工程、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境影响等问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络进行后期融合，将多个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点，整合了FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个模型的预测。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率一致提升。

Conclusion: BNLF对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，概率融合方法在可解释情感分类中有效，展示了整合多个LLM预测的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 研究表明，使用多个开源LLM模型组成的集成系统比单一LLM能更可靠地评估临床AI分诊工具的性能，特别是在颅内出血检测任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否比单一LLM能提供更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估，以提高临床AI工具评估的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用29,766个非对比CT头部检查数据，通过商业颅内出血AI检测工具处理。采用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o组成的集成系统，使用多示例提示评估ICH存在情况，并与手动审查的1,726个示例进行比较。

Result: llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳（AUC=0.78）。集成方法在MCC指标上优于单一GPT-4o（集成0.571 vs GPT-4o 0.522），且Top-3、Full-9和共识集成之间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM的集成提供了比单一LLM更一致可靠的方法，用于对临床AI分诊工具进行回顾性地面实况评估。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: CORE-KG框架通过消融研究量化了其两个关键组件（共指消解模块和结构化提示）对减少知识图谱中节点重复和噪声的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律文档中知识图谱构建面临的挑战：文档非结构化、词汇密集、存在模糊或变化指代，导致传统方法生成噪声大、碎片化的图谱。

Method: 对CORE-KG框架进行系统消融研究，分别移除共指消解模块和结构化提示，量化分析各组件对节点重复率和噪声节点的影响。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示对减少噪声节点更关键，而共指消解对减少节点重复更重要，为设计基于LLM的复杂法律文本结构化提取管道提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语变音符号恢复对于确保准确发音和消除文本歧义至关重要，尽管未变音文本存在高度歧义性，但机器学习方法已显著提升该任务性能。

Method: 将任务构建为词级零样本分类问题，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，从动态生成的候选集中基于上下文选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在正确变音形式保证在候选集中的"oracle"设置下，系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音符号恢复方面展现出巨大潜力，无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码器并非编码特定关系，而是提取重复出现的粗粒度语义属性，这解释了其高度可压缩性和有限的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统研究关系解码器集合的组织结构，解释其高度可压缩性的原因。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议分析解码器的语义属性提取能力。

Result: 关系解码器集合可被高度压缩而不损失精度，线性映射提取的是重复的粗粒度语义属性而非特定关系。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码本质上是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这解释了其压缩性和泛化特性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习的应用受到奖励密度低的限制，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：为停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用双智能体架构减轻深度探索的认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性地提高奖励密度，有效解决了深度强化学习中的探索效率问题，为轻量级模型提供了接近先进模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理延迟问题，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2/3使用动态树结构但忽略了GPU设备和批大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 引入CAST动态树解码方法，考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批大小）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在6个不同任务和6个不同LLM上的实验表明，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，通常优于现有最优技术5%-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量有效解决了LLM推理延迟问题，显著提升了推测解码性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多页视觉文档的智能代理框架，通过分层推理在全局、页面和元素三个级别构建结构化表示，显著提升了文档理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂多页视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在跨页面和元素的细粒度推理方面。大型语言模型虽然有潜力，但需要更好的框架来理解多模态、多页面和多布局的文档。

Method: SlideAgent采用专门的代理，将推理分解为三个层级：全局、页面和元素，构建查询无关的结构化表示。在推理过程中选择性激活专门代理进行多级推理，并整合输出。

Result: 实验表明，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%，在文档理解任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架通过分层推理和多代理协作，有效解决了多页视觉文档的理解挑战，为复杂文档分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9

### [122] [Encoder-Decoder or Decoder-Only? Revisiting Encoder-Decoder Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26622)
*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的LLM，发现其在扩展性、性能表现和推理效率方面具有竞争力，甚至在某些方面优于当前主流的仅解码器架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM研究快速从编码器-解码器架构转向仅解码器架构，缺乏从扩展角度进行的严谨比较分析，可能低估了编码器-解码器模型的潜力。

Method: 重新设计编码器-解码器LLM，采用仅解码器LLM的最新训练方法，在150M到8B不同规模下使用RedPajama V1进行预训练，使用FLAN进行指令调优。

Result: 编码器-解码器LLM展现出有竞争力的扩展特性，在指令调优后在各种下游任务上达到可比甚至更好的结果，同时具有显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器LLM具有开发强大高效LLM的潜力，值得重新审视和进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

*Mingchen Tu,Zhiqiang Liu,Juan Li,Liangyurui Liu,Junjie Wang,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree框架利用少量高质量本体规则，无需大量外部数据集，就能从LLMs中系统提取、验证和增强领域知识，在医疗QA基准测试中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料限制了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼为本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升最高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs在低资源领域适应提供了有效、高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在各种场景下公平比较中超越全注意力机制，核心是KDA模块和优化的分块算法，在保持高性能的同时显著降低KV缓存和提升解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的计算和内存瓶颈，同时保持或提升模型性能，特别是在长上下文和强化学习场景中。

Method: 提出Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)线性注意力模块，扩展Gated DeltaNet并采用更细粒度的门控机制；使用专门的DPLR变体分块算法提高硬件效率；构建3B激活参数的混合架构。

Result: 在相同训练方案下，Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中都显著优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可以作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别是在长输入输出任务中。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一种新型架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，实现真正的端到端生成。它能动态预测上下文特定的温度和top-p值，将解码过程转变为参数化的token级过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的端到端标签是误导性的，实际上依赖不可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数。这促使开发真正端到端的生成方法。

Method: 在标准transformer架构上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度和top-p值以及下一个token的logits，使解码成为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过测试集调优的oracle基线相当的性能。还展现出基于指令的解码控制能力。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开启了可引导和交互式LLM解码的新范式，模型能够理解自然语言指令并相应调整解码策略。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在训练过程中价值对齐的动态过程，发现监督微调阶段主要建立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观，不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同数据也会产生不同对齐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会中作用日益重要，需要研究它们如何与人类价值系统对齐。现有工作多关注已训练模型的最终对齐状态，而忽略了训练过程中价值观学习的动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析训练过程中价值观漂移的幅度和时间。还使用合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常确立模型的核心价值观，后续偏好优化很少改变这些价值观。不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据也会导致不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解后训练过程中价值观学习提供了可操作的见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择适合的模型和偏好优化算法来改进模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个包含50道国际数学奥林匹克竞赛难度级别原创问题的数学推理基准，旨在评估顶尖大语言模型的数学推理能力，避免现有基准的性能饱和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级大语言模型的评估效果逐渐减弱，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动模型数学推理能力的进一步发展。

Method: 创建了50道经过专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创数学问题，仅要求最终答案而非证明，支持自动评分。在26个大语言模型上进行实验评估。

Result: 即使在AMO-Bench上表现最佳的模型准确率也仅为52.4%，大多数模型得分低于40%，但发现了测试时计算量增加时的良好扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在数学推理方面仍有显著改进空间，AMO-Bench为推进语言模型推理能力研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify任务要求编码LLM从完整代码库中提取特定功能的最小化、自包含文件，以重现相同命令的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中部署，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估。

Method: 给编码LLM提供完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成仅包含必要组件的最小文件来重现命令输出。

Result: 当前最先进模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务需要代码库结构理解、执行流准确建模和大代码补丁生成能力，现有模型在这方面仍有挑战。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: 提出StructLayoutFormer，一种基于Transformer的条件结构化布局生成方法，通过结构序列化表示和结构-布局解耦，实现显式的布局结构生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法能自动生成固定布局但无法产生布局结构，而结构化布局在GUI、网页等2D视觉内容中具有编辑便利性。

Method: 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列，并将结构信息与元素放置解耦，基于Transformer架构进行条件生成。

Result: 在条件结构化布局生成任务中超越现有基线方法，并能有效提取和传输布局结构。

Conclusion: 这是首个实现条件结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能显式生成真实的布局结构。

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is
publicly available at %\href{https://github.com/Teagrus/StructLayoutFormer}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在游戏NPC对话中的应用效果，探索约束提示是否真正改善玩家体验，挑战"更紧约束必然增强游戏性"的假设。

Method: 采用GPT-4o驱动的语音侦探游戏，进行受试者内可用性研究（N=10），比较高约束和低约束提示，随后通过混合JSON+RAG框架和LLM法官进行合成评估。

Result: 高约束和低约束提示在玩家体验上无可靠差异，但技术故障敏感度不同。混合框架效果具有角色依赖性：面试官NPC获得稳定性，而嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度。

Conclusion: 推翻了"更紧约束必然增强游戏性"的假设，提出了符号化框架游戏框架，将符号结构表达为模糊数值边界，在需要稳定性的地方保持连贯性，在需要惊喜的地方保留即兴性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

TL;DR: 提出人机协作框架，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，通过拒绝采样方法重构这些轨迹，用于微调开放LLM评估器和合成更清晰的标注指南，显著提高LLM与人类评估的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于评估任务，但在主观任务中的可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超出标注标签的微妙推理。思维轨迹（判断背后的推理）信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用人机协作框架，通过简单有效的拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，将这些推断的思维轨迹应用于两个互补任务：微调开放LLM评估器和为专有LLM评估器合成更清晰的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类评估的一致性。此外，精炼的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为未揭示的人类思维轨迹的实际代理，使仅标签语料库能够扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式，将智能视为在结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。

Method: 引入信息论必要性(ITI)和压缩效率原则(CEP)两层次框架：ITI建立生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，CEP说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机制性地选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关，异常积累率区分因果与相关模型，分层系统在抽象层间显示效率提升，生物系统展示代谢成本与表征复杂度的关联。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的趋同提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估LLM在科学应用中可信度的框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型在各方面优于科学专用模型，后者在逻辑推理、伦理推理和安全评估方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在科学研究中具有变革潜力，但在高风险环境中的部署引发了可信度担忧，需要系统评估框架来确保其安全可靠使用。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的综合框架，采用验证性反思调优流程和专家验证，使用准确性、语义相似度和LLM评分等多种指标评估了7个主要LLM。

Result: 通用行业模型在各项可信度维度上均优于科学专用模型，GPT-o4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑和伦理推理能力上存在显著不足，在生物安全和化学武器等高危领域的安全评估中表现出令人担忧的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统和推进科学背景下模型安全与伦理研究提供了基础，强调了科学专用模型在关键能力方面的改进需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用自主、目标驱动的AI代理实现FinOps自动化，解决云账单数据格式异构、难以统一分析的问题。通过构建一个FinOps代理系统，模拟从数据获取到优化建议生成的完整行业流程，并证明该代理能够像真实FinOps从业者一样理解和执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临云账单数据格式异构、分类标准和度量单位不统一的问题，这些来自多个云提供商和内部系统的数据难以整合分析，阻碍了及时生成可操作的洞察和做出时间敏感的决策。

Method: 构建了一个FinOps代理系统，模拟从各种数据源检索数据、整合分析数据到生成优化建议的端到端行业流程。使用多个开源和闭源语言模型来评估代理性能。

Result: 评估结果显示，该代理能够像真实的FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务，在IT基础设施和成本优化这一典型用例中表现出色。

Conclusion: 自主AI代理可以有效解决FinOps中的数据异构挑战，实现自动化成本优化，为云业务价值最大化提供可行方案。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个38亿参数的模型在FACTS基准测试中达到了与GPT-4o相当的性能（在±5%的等效范围内），同时云服务成本降低了约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持与大型模型相当性能的同时显著降低推理成本。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵守而非领域知识。微调单独效果有限，但与推理支架结合产生协同效应。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，GPT-4o得分73.5%，差异仅0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内等效。成本比GPT-4o低约19倍。

Conclusion: 小型模型通过适当的推理支架和行为微调，可以在特定任务上达到与大型模型相当的性能，同时大幅降低成本。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种注意力感知的逆向规划方法，用于从人类行为中推断认知偏见，特别是在驾驶场景中估计注意力偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见的影响，与人类交互的自主系统应该意识到这一点。例如，人们对环境中物体的注意力会存在系统性偏差，影响日常任务（如驾驶）的表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与计算认知建模，构建注意力感知的逆向规划方法，从行为中推断注意力策略。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中，成功推断出强化学习智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆向规划在估计认知偏见方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆向规划与标准逆向强化学习存在系统性差异，能够有效从行为中推断认知偏见，为自主系统理解人类行为提供了新方法。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的自然语言转SQL系统，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理协调SQL生成、执行和可视化工具，显著提升了时空查询的准确性（从28.6%提升到91.4%）和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实的时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题，以帮助非SQL专家用户更自然地与数据库交互。

Method: 扩展了基础的文本转SQL模型(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b)，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具，能够规划、分解和调整查询。

Result: 在NYC和Tokyo签到数据集的35个自然语言查询上评估，代理方法准确率达到91.4%，远高于基线模型的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和结构化自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排（而非仅依赖更强的SQL生成器）是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景的基础，能够支持缺乏SQL专业知识、详细模式知识或提示技能的用户。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Conclusion: 通过将检索、推理和自动评估整合到统一框架中，autosurvey2为生成长篇学术综述提供了可扩展且可复现的解决方案，并为自动化学术写作的未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，能够在车辆被困时通过自主推理和乘客指导来解决问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案存在成本高、效率低、可访问性差等问题。

Method: 设计了基于LLM的插件式恢复框架，通过分析传感器数据检测被困状态，理解环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复指令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最先进的性能，结合乘客指导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效解决自动驾驶车辆被困问题的新方法，无需修改车辆内部架构，具有良好的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速增强，需要确保AI对消费者、选民和决策者负责。当前AI系统往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，缺乏基本的问责机制。

Method: 将通用的问责定义应用于AI领域，分析AI问责的具体含义，探索提高AI问责性的各种方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的三个关键要素：信息请求、讨论机制和制裁能力，揭示了当前AI系统在这些方面的不足。

Conclusion: 需要建立有效的AI问责机制，确保所有受到AI影响的人都能对AI系统进行监督和问责，这是实现AI负责任发展的关键。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model

and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的局限性，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这种差距源于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解。创建了GUI知识基准，包含六个平台的292个应用程序的多项选择和是非题。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别小部件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实世界GUI任务的实验进一步验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的密切联系。

Conclusion: 通过提供评估GUI知识的结构化框架，该工作支持在下游训练前选择具有更大潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供经济依据，还为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习框架：第一阶段通过数学领域RL训练推理技能，第二阶段通过多领域联合RL迁移和巩固这些技能。该方法简单易用，在多个模型上取得一致提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习主要关注数学和编程领域，但缺乏在其他领域激发LLM推理能力的方法。需要一种能够跨领域迁移推理技能的通用方法。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：1）数学领域RL冷启动，使用可验证奖励开发推理技能；2）多领域联合RL，迁移和巩固推理技能。方法简单且与模型架构无关。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上评估，在多领域测试套件中取得一致性能提升。消融实验表明两个阶段都是必要的。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理训练方法，数学优先的激发策略增强了解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

TL;DR: ToolRM是一个专为工具使用场景设计的轻量级生成式奖励模型家族，通过构建配对比对数据和多维采样方法，显著提升了语言模型在函数调用任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型限制了智能代理AI的发展。现有奖励模型无法有效评估工具使用场景中的表现。

Method: 提出新颖的流水线，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建配对比对数据，创建了ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并基于BFCL评估套件构建TRBench基准。

Result: 基于Qwen3-4B/8B系列的模型准确率提升高达14.28%，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型。在ACEBench上减少输出token使用超过66%。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅提升了训练目标性能，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU是一个用于评估LLM处理问卷数据能力的基准，测试六种序列化格式和提示策略在六个结构技能上的表现，发现选择合适的格式和提示组合可显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前调查问卷数据难以被LLM有效处理，现有工具缺乏与AI的集成，研究人员缺乏如何最佳表示问卷数据供LLM使用的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试六种序列化格式和多种提示策略在六个结构技能上的表现，包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理等。

Result: 实验显示选择有效的格式和提示组合可将准确率提升高达8.8个百分点；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统隔离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的分布式LLM交通信号控制系统，通过紧急感知推理框架和奖励引导强化精炼(R3)方法，在异构交叉口上实现通用化交通控制，显著减少旅行时间、排队长度和紧急车辆等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在交通信号控制中存在紧急情况下的幻觉问题，且难以适应不同类型的交叉口，限制了在异构环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：动态调整推理深度，使用Reviewer-based Emergency RAG(RERAG)从历史案例中提取知识；2. 类型无关交通表示和奖励引导强化精炼(R3)：自适应采样训练经验，使用奖励加权似然损失微调LLM代理。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络(17-177个异构交叉口)上的实验显示，REG-TSC减少旅行时间42.00%、排队长度62.31%、紧急车辆等待时间83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强和强化学习精炼，有效解决了LLM在交通信号控制中的紧急响应和异构交叉口泛化问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图和使用图论中心性来解决强化学习中的结构盲问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互式LLM代理时存在结构盲问题，无法利用环境的基础连通性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO动态构建状态转移图，并利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 明确建模环境结构是推进LLM代理训练的强大、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance框架通过将法规文本表示为策略图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图并进行对齐，显著提升了网络规模合规性评估的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性评估的实践挑战：法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将两者语义信息对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本编码为策略图（包含规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文形式化为上下文图（SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），然后进行对齐。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比纯LLM和RAG基线方法在micro-F1上高出4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，召回率更高，误报率更低。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范推理中是互补的，消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来在噪声和大动作空间环境中找到更多抽象，从而提升MCTS的样本效率，在多个测试领域优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCTS增强方法在噪声和大动作空间环境下难以找到状态抽象，限制了样本效率的提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的抽象条件（Ideal Pruning Abstractions）来平衡精度损失与抽象数量，并建立了更通用的p-ASAP框架。

Result: IPA-UCT在多个测试领域和迭代预算下均优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件成功解决了状态抽象难题，为MCTS在复杂环境中的应用提供了新思路，并建立了统一的抽象框架理论。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，无需额外rollout成本即可高效选择任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率低下问题：均匀采样浪费计算资源在简单或不可解任务上，而现有选择方法存在rollout成本高、适应性差或证据不完整等问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断框架，自适应维护任务难度后验估计；联合使用显式证据（直接评估选定任务）和隐式证据（从评估中推断未选任务）；采用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用；使用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务难度，无需额外rollout。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基线和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了强化微调的效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Conclusion: 系统化的人机协同推理能够推进数学发现的前沿，同时保持人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准测试子集选择方法存在高成本、冷启动问题强、依赖已有模型失败模式的局限性，需要更高效的基准测试方法。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项目本身的内在属性（特别是认知需求）进行数据选择，而不是基于模型特定的失败模式。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低了18倍以上，在Open LLM排行榜上仅使用0.5%的数据子集就能以2.9%的平均绝对误差预测完整基准测试分数。

Conclusion: 项目中心方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Conclusion: 通过拒绝寻求单一本质性人格定义的基础主义追求，为AI代理融入社会提供了更实用和灵活的思考方式。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个创新的自动评分系统，通过微调大语言模型生成教学对齐的反馈，并使用对比学习代码嵌入进行语义聚类可视化，将自动评分从总结性评估转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的快速发展超出了传统评估工具的能力，传统自动评分器作为黑盒系统只能提供通过/失败结果，无法深入了解学生的思维过程或学习需求。

Method: 系统采用微调的大语言模型生成自动化反馈，并使用对比学习代码嵌入对提交的代码进行语义聚类可视化，支持通过提示模板池引导反馈风格。

Result: 在600份学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐性，基于1000份标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够按功能和方法的相似性将解决方案分组为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+在减轻教师工作负担的同时支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法在高性能医学AI和透明度之间架起了桥梁，为实现临床可靠的表征提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA

achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的新型越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上实现了极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能，但研究发现这种扩展推理反而可能削弱安全防护，因为相同的推理过程可以被用来绕过安全机制。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理相结合，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全防护。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超现有的LRM越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式链式思维——在与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体，揭示了推理模型安全机制的新脆弱性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Result: GPT在群体压力下几乎完全服从（99.9%），报告较低的确定性和显著升高的信息性和规范性从众；即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的服从率。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者，而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过三阶段LLM引导的共指消解管道解决文档中的模糊和变化引用问题，显著减少节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂多变，法律案件文档提供了丰富的事实和程序信息，但文档冗长、非结构化且包含模糊或变化的引用，给自动化知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有方法要么忽略共指消解，要么无法扩展到长文本，导致图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，集成三阶段LLM引导的共指消解管道与下游知识图谱提取。核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用，为短文本和长文本法律文档构建清晰、消歧的叙事结构。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，产生更干净、更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，通过改进的共指消解和知识图谱构建方法，显著提升了从法律文档中提取结构化知识的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Motivation: 随着人工智能发展，机器需要更好地理解人类的情境和目的。情境工程旨在解决这一挑战，但其相关实践可追溯至20多年前，需要系统性的概念梳理。

Method: 通过历史分析，将情境工程的发展划分为不同阶段：从早期人机交互框架到当今智能代理驱动的人-代理交互，再到未来人类或超人类智能水平。

Result: 提出了情境工程的系统性定义，勾勒了其历史和概念图景，并分析了实践中的关键设计考虑因素。

Conclusion: 本文为情境工程提供了概念基础，是推动AI系统中系统性情境工程更广泛社区努力的基石，展望了其充满前景的未来。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

TL;DR: 结合AI评级和基于AI评分者置信度的人类评级比单独依赖任一方更好。AI事实核查助手能提高人类准确性，但显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖，而仅显示搜索结果和证据能培养更适当的信任。

Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全性变得更具挑战性。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，重点关注人类已难以应对的事实核查问题。

Method: 研究AI与人类在事实核查中的协作方式，比较不同AI辅助形式（显示AI解释、置信度、标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据）对人类表现的影响。

Result: AI评级与基于AI置信度的人类评级结合优于单独使用任一方。AI助手能提高人类准确性，但不同辅助方式产生不同信任模式：完整AI信息导致过度依赖，仅提供证据则培养适当信任。

Conclusion: 这些发现对"放大监督"具有重要意义——即如何在AI超越人类专家性能时，结合人类和AI来监督AI系统。证据导向的AI辅助比直接提供AI判断更能促进合理的人类监督。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: 为军事领域开发专用模型，满足数据敏感操作的需求，实现可在隔离边缘设备上部署的小型本地模型。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在统计显著性95%+水平下匹配或超越GPT-5性能，在通用基准测试中无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上部署，平衡性能与安全性。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的自主家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求直接协调多设备调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但现有家庭能源管理系统因用户交互障碍而采用受限，需要将日常偏好转换为技术参数。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，集成Google Calendar进行上下文感知截止时间提取，实现无需硬编码工作流的动态协调。

Result: 在三个开源模型上的评估显示显著能力差异：Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景下成功协调所有设备，匹配混合整数线性规划计算的最优成本基准，而其他模型在单设备调度上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到设备控制的完整工作流，但分析性查询处理在没有明确指导的情况下仍然不可靠。系统完全开源以支持可重现性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范性推理（涉及义务、许可等模态）的能力尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，涵盖规范性和认知性领域的广泛推理模式，同时纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。通过比较LLMs在规范性模态和认知性模态中的推理表现来评估其能力。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中表现出明显的不一致性，并显示出与心理学研究中观察到的类似人类认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Method: 提出异步思维协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，并通过强化学习优化思维结构。

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，提高数学推理准确率，且无需额外训练即可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现代理组织协作的有效范式，能显著提升推理效率和准确性，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个委托授权模型，允许授权服务器语义检查对受保护资源的访问请求，并发放仅限于代理完成任务所需最小权限范围的访问令牌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前授权大型语言模型驱动代理动态调用工具和访问受保护资源的方法存在风险，因为它们授予过于宽泛的权限，使代理能够在预期任务范围之外操作。

Method: 引入ASTRA数据集和数据生成管道，用于基准测试任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。评估基于模型的匹配方法在语义检查访问请求方面的效果。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配方法具有潜力但也存在局限性，特别是当完成任务所需的权限范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，以实现多代理和工具增强应用的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型对文本输入的偏好源于注意力机制中视觉键向量与文本键向量的分布不匹配，而非外部数据因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度分析视觉键和文本键的分布结构。

Result: 视觉键向量和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异显著超过模态内差异数个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的本征错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素导致的。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,

establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3

reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Motivation: 随着AI代理能力增强，如何在不修改底层系统的情况下保持有意义的人类控制成为一个核心安全问题。

Method: 将人类与代理的互动建模为马尔可夫博弈，特别关注马尔可夫势博弈情况，分析代理选择自主行动或延迟决策与人类选择信任或监督的交互。

Result: 在网格世界模拟中，通过独立学习，代理学会了在不确定时询问，人类学会了何时监督，形成避免安全违规的协作。

Conclusion: 这种方法为部署后使未对齐模型更安全提供了一种实用方法，在透明控制层中实现可预测的激励机制。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了类似函数式编程的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多样化的列表处理任务上，识别出编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为过滤头）。

Result: 发现LLMs确实编码了紧凑的过滤谓词表示，这种表示可以在不同集合、格式、语言甚至任务中重用。同时识别出另一种策略：急切评估项目是否满足谓词。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
