### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的新方法，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中渲染速度慢和传感器不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢或仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试中对高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且多传感器模拟存在跨传感器不一致问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT方法，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计了因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致问题。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均降低40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了自动驾驶测试中多传感器模拟的关键挑战。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SurgFUTR框架，将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习，通过教师-学生架构和动作动态模块实现跨任务的统一预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对孤立任务，缺乏统一方法，且难以泛化到不同手术场景。

Method: 采用状态变化学习方法，通过Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频压缩为状态表示，使用教师-学生架构，教师网络学习当前和未来视频，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，并引入动作动态模块。

Result: 在四个数据集和三种手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序转移验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SurgFUTR通过状态变化学习框架有效解决了手术未来预测问题，在多个任务上表现出色且具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，使用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未见域上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在不同条件下采集的图像上诊断准确性下降，主要原因是疾病症状的细微变化和领域差距，以及训练数据多样性不足。

Method: 基于度量学习的目标感知度量学习与优先采样(TMPS)框架，利用少量目标域标记样本来提高诊断鲁棒性。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS框架能有效利用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在跨域场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需文本标签的视觉语言对齐框架，通过主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征来改进图像描述生成，无需完整重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐框架ViZer，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需文本标签或完整重新训练。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上的应用显示，ViZer在定性评估中产生更准确和描述性的图像描述，但自动化指标如CIDEr和BERTScore可能惩罚参考描述中缺失的细节。

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，能够在不依赖标注数据的情况下改进现有模型的图像描述能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专为胎儿超声设计的医疗AI系统，通过临床工作流引导的显著认知解耦方法，解决了胎儿超声中多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性的挑战，在报告生成和诊断任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，因为胎儿超声面临多视图图像推理、众多疾病类型和图像多样性等独特挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导模型沿临床步骤进行偏好选择，减少疾病变异性和视图异质性带来的学习瓶颈。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均提升14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流引导的SED方法和大规模数据集FetalSigma-1M，成功解决了胎儿超声领域的独特挑战，为胎儿超声AI系统的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级频谱EMA和QSilk微纹理稳定器，在不重新训练的情况下提升图像锐度、提示遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决SD/SDXL模型在采样过程中存在的图像细节不足、伪影问题以及在高分辨率下纹理不自然的问题，开发一个无需重新训练即可提升图像质量的采样器级引导系统。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG结合了三种技术：(1)频率解耦引导，对引导信号的低频和高频分量进行重新加权；(2)能量重缩放，使引导预测的幅度与正分支匹配；(3)零投影，移除与无条件方向平行的分量。同时使用轻量级频谱EMA进行模式切换，并采用QSilk微纹理稳定器进行推理时稳定。

Result: 该方法在SD/SDXL采样器上显著提升了图像锐度、提示遵循度和伪影控制能力，在高分辨率下能够生成自然的高频微纹理，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一个有效的采样器级引导解决方案，无需模型重新训练即可显著提升SD/SDXL模型的图像生成质量，特别是在细节增强和稳定性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

### [7] [Scope: Selective Cross-modal Orchestration of Visual Perception Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12974)
*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，在减少24-49%计算量的同时，性能优于同时使用所有编码器的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器虽然能提升视觉语言模型性能，但简单堆叠会导致收益递减且推理成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择方法。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器使用文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来选择最优编码器，采用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器+1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型，性能优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%的计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

### [8] [SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016)
*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言描述动作的所有参考对象。构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集和SVAGFormer基线框架，实验显示现有模型在复杂场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽视了基于动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 构建了包含688个视频、19,590个标注记录和903个独特动词的大规模基准SVAG-Bench。实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现较差，特别是在密集或复杂场景中。

Conclusion: 需要在长视频中对细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级的推理，现有方法在复杂场景中的时空动作定位能力不足。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Result: 容量从100比特提升到500比特，错误率降至2000比特中仅有1比特错误，视觉质量达到31.47 dB PSNR和0.13 LPIPS。

Conclusion: 新颖的感知设计在创建多模态潜在表示方面有效，显著提升了隐写术的性能。

Abstract: Steganography finds its use in visual medium such as providing metadata and
watermarking. With support of efficient latent representations and foveated
rendering, we trained models that improve existing capacity limits from 100 to
500 bits, while achieving better accuracy of up to 1 failure bit out of 2000,
at 200K test bits. Finally, we achieve a comparable visual quality of 31.47 dB
PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS, showing the effectiveness of novel perceptual design in
creating multi-modal latent representations in steganography.

### [10] [SeqBench: Benchmarking Sequential Narrative Generation in Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13042)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准，用于评估文本到视频生成中的顺序叙事连贯性，包括320个提示的数据集和基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，揭示了当前T2V模型在保持多动作序列一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成连贯的顺序叙事方面存在困难，而当前的T2V基准主要关注视觉质量指标，缺乏对扩展序列中叙事连贯性的评估。

Method: 构建了包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖不同叙事复杂度，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标来捕获长程依赖和时序关系。

Result: 基于DTG的指标与人类标注有强相关性。评估揭示了当前T2V模型在多动作序列中保持对象状态一致性、多对象场景中的物理合理性以及保持时序关系方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的顺序推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于DBNet++文本检测和BART分类器的自动文档分类系统，支持离线图像和实时摄像头输入，对发票、报告、信件和表单四类文档进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中因光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或遮挡文本、低分辨率等挑战导致的文档分类困难。

Method: 四阶段流程：图像采集与预处理、DBNet++文本检测、BART文本分类、PyQt5用户界面集成。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上文本检测准确率达到92.88%，系统在非约束成像场景下对混合来源文档分类有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂实际场景中具有实用价值，能够有效处理各种挑战性文档分类任务。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成），利用不相关的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集，将场景感知注入到文本条件运动模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么关注运动语义，要么关注场景感知，但缺乏同时具备丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务，通过关键帧层调节运动潜在空间进行中间帧生成，然后添加场景条件层通过交叉注意力注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt能有效将场景感知注入文本到运动模型，并分析了这种感知能力的出现机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt通过创新的两阶段适应方法成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据和3D运动标注即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、地面真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。本文旨在通过结合2D对象无关先验和SDF表示来放宽这些要求。

Method: 将符号距离函数(SDF)与3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)集成，利用两者的优势创建更鲁棒的对象表示。采用统一的优化框架增强3DGS的几何精度并改进SDF内的变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景中无需LiDAR数据即可在渲染指标上达到最先进性能。加入LiDAR后能进一步改善重建和生成新视图的能力，且无需地面真实3D运动标注。支持场景分解和组合等编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS，实现了更灵活、精确的动态场景表示，显著降低了对数据要求的依赖，同时保持了高质量的渲染和重建性能。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [15] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验的自监督新视角合成模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了真正的姿态可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成模型的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性——同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，这限制了模型的真实新视角合成能力。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与简单的输入输出增强方案，联合解耦相机姿态与场景内容，促进几何推理，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量而不需要3D归纳偏置或多视图几何概念。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态新视角合成变换器，实现了真正的姿态可迁移性，潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何先验即可实现真正的新视角合成，为自监督学习中的几何理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外与可见光图像融合，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号，提升边缘清晰度和纹理保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将梯度压缩为幅值会丢失方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不佳，需要保留梯度方向信息来改善融合质量。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留其符号，不改变模型架构或训练协议。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公开基准测试上的实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘和更丰富的纹理保留。

Conclusion: 方向感知的梯度损失为图像融合提供了明确的方向指导，显著提升了边缘保真度和纹理质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督域自适应框架，通过双向可变形图像配准和风格协调来解决医学图像分割中的域偏移问题，特别关注内容变化，在跨域海马体分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时，由于域偏移（包括图像外观的风格变化和人群相关的解剖特征内容变化）而性能下降，需要解决跨域海马体分割中的这一挑战。

Method: 结合z-归一化进行高效风格协调，采用双向可变形图像配准策略，配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的评估显示，该方法优于现有基线。从年轻健康人群迁移到临床痴呆患者时，Dice分数相对标准增强方法提升高达15%，在内容偏移大的场景中收益最大。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现跨不同人群的准确海马体分割，特别适用于存在显著内容域偏移的场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种量化扩散概率模型中计数幻觉的方法，构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件，并分析了不同采样条件对计数幻觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集套件，开发标准化评估协议，系统分析不同采样条件对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 发现FID等常用评估指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为图像生成中幻觉现象的研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Edit-Your-Interest，一种轻量级、文本驱动的零样本视频编辑方法，通过时空特征内存和特征传播机制显著降低计算开销，同时保持时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在高计算开销和内存消耗问题，且常导致时间不一致性和视觉伪影（如模糊和马赛克）。

Method: 引入时空特征内存库(SFM)缓存特征，提出特征最相似传播(FMP)保持时间一致性，使用SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 在效率和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest通过创新的时空特征管理和传播机制，实现了高效、高质量的视频编辑，解决了现有方法的计算瓶颈和视觉质量问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

*Xijun Wang,Tanay Sharma,Achin Kulshrestha,Abhimitra Meka,Aveek Purohit,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手在社交互动中缺乏干预时机感知能力的问题，显著提升了干预时机检测和社交互动理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AR/VR技术融入日常生活，需要AI从第一人称视角理解人类社交动态。当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，无法判断何时作为AI助手进行干预，导致频繁且不合时宜的响应，干扰自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的大规模第一人称数据集EgoSocial；提出了EgoSoD方法，集成多模态上下文线索（音频和视觉）到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动；基于OLLM分析，主动检测干预时机和社交互动。

Result: 实验显示OLLMs在检测干预时机方面表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅为14.4%）；EgoSoD方法在干预时机性能上使Phi-4提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；在整体社交互动性能上使Phi-4提升20.4%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法通过多模态上下文集成和动态社交建模，有效解决了AI助手在社交互动中的干预时机检测问题，显著提升了社交意识能力，为AR/VR环境中的智能助手发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类对齐的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 改进现有的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准方法，确保配准变换的质量，提供准确的逆变换，这对神经影像工作流程至关重要。

Method: 使用变分原理(VP)网格生成方法，构建具有规定雅可比行列度和旋度的无折叠网格，在微分同胚群中生成逆变换而非图像空间。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、变换规律性以及逆映射的准确性和一致性方面均优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg在配准精度和变换质量控制方面表现优异，为计算解剖学和形态测量学提供了可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Conclusion: OS-HGAdapter通过增强文本信息熵和超图多边连接，有效解决了跨模态检索不平衡问题，显著提升了语义对齐性能

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去噪模型大多在模拟或单一真实场景数据上训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特征的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 利用TEM信号固有的物理特性（指数衰减和平滑性）作为先验知识，通过字典学习编码这些特性，并在训练时集成到DTEMDNet网络中。测试时通过最小化字典驱动一致性和信号一阶变分的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法在TEM去噪性能上显著优于现有TEM去噪方法和TTA方法。

Conclusion: DP-TTA方法通过利用TEM信号的固有物理特性作为先验知识，有效提升了模型在不同地理环境下的泛化能力和去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，不适用于专门最大化高斯泼溅质量的场景重建任务。需要解决客户端异构视图贡献的评估与通信资源分配的因果关系困境。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：1) 使用特征域聚类(FDC)从每个客户端采样代表性图像作为导频数据；2) 采用导频传输时间最小化(PTTM)减少开销；3) 基于导频评估开发联合客户端选择和功率控制(JCSPC)框架，使用惩罚交替主化最小化(PAMM)算法求解非凸问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基准。仅需10%的低采样率即可准确预测高斯泼溅目标函数，在视图贡献和通信成本之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的STT-GS策略有效解决了边缘高斯泼溅中的资源管理问题，通过两阶段采样和优化框架实现了高质量的场景重建，同时控制了通信开销。

scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构改进，很少从表示融合角度探索，导致2D图像中丰富的特征多样性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出两阶段占用预测框架，提取分割、图形和深度特征，引入可变形多级融合机制融合这些多级特征，并集成SAM知识蒸馏。

Result: 在不增加训练成本的情况下，在SemanticKITTI基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CIGOcc通过多级表示融合有效提升了基于相机的3D占用预测性能，证明了表示融合策略的有效性。

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

Conclusion: Paper Copilot资源有助于社区追踪变化、诊断故障模式，并为建立更稳健、透明和可靠的同行评审系统提供信息支持。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过分区风格注入和分区去噪网络来生成更具表现力的3D人体运动，解决了现有方法在风格多样性和区域运动差异方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法要么过度简化风格多样性，要么忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身与下身），且未能让运动风格随语音节奏和情感变化动态调整，限制了运动真实感。

Method: 将身体分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，使用分区风格注入和分区去噪网络，通过分区注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，生成了更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts框架通过分区处理能够捕捉细粒度区域差异，使生成的运动更好地与语音节奏和情感状态的变化保持一致。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这些技术及其各自应用的系统区分，需要澄清概念并建立统一框架。

Method: 从第一原理重新审视VP和VPT的设计，将其概念化为统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，提供基于可学习性(可学习、生成、不可学习)和注入粒度(像素级、令牌级)的分类法。

Result: 建立了PA的统一框架和分类体系，涵盖了医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等多个领域的应用，以及测试时适应和可信AI中的角色。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，为研究人员和从业者提供了清晰的路线图，以理解和探索PA相关研究的演进格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

TL;DR: 提出一种面向工业表面缺陷检测的样本中心多任务学习框架，通过联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，解决传统像素中心方法在样本级决策稳定性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极端前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏性、尺度分布长尾和低对比度等挑战，现有模型在像素重叠指标上表现良好但在样本级决策稳定性不足，特别是对于稀疏或细长缺陷。

Method: 采用共享编码器架构，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，通过样本级监督调制特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升小尺寸和低对比度缺陷的召回率。

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心多任务学习框架和评估指标能够有效解决工业缺陷检测中样本级决策稳定性问题，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

TL;DR: 提出了CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块来解决视觉语言模型在否定理解上的affirmative bias问题，显著提升了否定检测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在理解否定时存在严重的affirmative bias，特别是在描述性目标检测任务中表现不佳。

Method: 使用CoT和VQA流程构建CoVAND数据集；提出NegToMe文本token合并模块，将否定词与属性绑定为语义短语，并结合LoRA微调。

Result: 在OVDEval基准上NMS-AP提升高达+10.8分，降低了误报率，并能泛化到其他先进VLM模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作为解决现实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互机制在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上均达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这源于将实例属性（类别、结构）和几何属性（点坐标、连接）独立处理，限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: UniVector将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块进行跨层级上下文交换迭代更新，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上均达到了新的最先进水平，并在新构建的Multi-Vector数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架成功实现了多种矢量类型的提取，为矢量提取领域提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更动态的多模态跟踪方法。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转化为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整提示，并设计判别性特征增强器。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack展现了强大的适应性和优越性能，证明了动态多模态提示在目标跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)及相应的防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过破坏视觉与文本潜在表示的语义对齐来干扰VLA模型，同时提出对抗性微调防御方案来缓解这种攻击。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习领域取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。作者旨在研究VLA模型在面对对抗性攻击时的脆弱性，并提出相应的防御机制。

Method: 提出EDPA攻击方法：通过(i)破坏视觉与文本潜在表示的语义对齐，(ii)最大化对抗性输入与干净输入潜在表示之间的差异来生成对抗补丁。同时提出防御策略：对视觉编码器进行对抗性微调，使其对干净和对抗性扰动输入产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御策略有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了VLA模型在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，并提供了有效的攻击和防御方法，为构建更鲁棒的VLA系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,

varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准和CymbaDiff方法为户外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估工具和先进解决方案。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 所提出的网络适用于嵌入式系统上的超实时人群计数，实现了最快的推理速度，同时确保了有竞争力的准确率。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Result: 发现VideoLLMs的时间推理遵循一致模式：早期层进行跨帧交互，中间层实现视频表征与时间概念语言嵌入的对齐和整合，中后层生成正确答案。通过选择有效信息路径，模型可在减少大量注意力边的情况下保持性能（如LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT减少58%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VideoLLMs执行时间推理的机制蓝图，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

### [40] [End-to-End Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13253)
*Chunhao Lu,Qiang Lu,Meichen Dong,Jake Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDM是一种基于Mamba的多模态扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器实现多模态处理的统一，在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和细化模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMLongCite是一个评估大型视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中忠实性的基准测试，包含8个任务、6种上下文长度区间，涵盖文本、图像和视频多种模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对长上下文忠实性的评估主要集中在纯文本领域，而多模态评估仅限于短上下文，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建MMLongCite基准测试，包含8个不同任务，跨越6个上下文长度区间，整合文本、图像和视频多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型的评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实性有限。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究上下文长度和关键内容位置如何影响模型的忠实性，以改进大型视觉语言模型在真实世界应用中的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过掩码退化分类和图像重建联合训练，实现通用图像恢复任务的高性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中效果有限，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型和级别的通用预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器-双解码器架构：编码器提取掩码低质量图像特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器恢复高质量图像。

Result: 在5D全合一恢复任务中PSNR提升至少3.77dB，真实场景PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为图像恢复任务提供了有效的预训练解决方案，显著提升CNN和Transformer性能，并发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于点云分割的新类发现方法(3D-NCD)，通过结构因果模型(SCM)学习基础类和新类之间的因果关系，实现仅使用基础类监督来分割未标记的新类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D-NCD方法通常采用粗略或统计相关性学习，可能导致新类推理混淆。通过引入因果关系的强相关约束，可以揭示准确对应类别的本质点云表示。

Method: 提出联合学习因果表示和推理的方法：首先通过SCM分析基础类表示中的隐藏混杂因子和基础类与新类之间的因果关系；设计因果表示原型消除混杂因子；使用图结构建模基础类因果表示原型与新类原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果表明该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 通过结构因果模型和因果推理，能够有效解决3D-NCD问题，准确分割未标记的新类。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM加速方法，在保持重建精度的同时实现了约40倍的速度提升，能够处理大规模场景（如5000张图像）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在CPU上运行存在计算开销大、灵活性有限的问题，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在处理大量视图时GPU内存消耗急剧增加。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的速度提升，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度，能够处理5000张图像的大规模场景。

Conclusion: 通过充分发挥GPU并行计算潜力，成功解决了SfM在大规模场景下的精度与速度权衡问题，为机器人重建和仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [45] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的解码策略，通过查询相关的视觉增强和自适应阈值算法，有效减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽视了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询与视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个令牌候选大小，充分利用对数分布信息。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询相关增强和熵感知解码对于改进LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型多模态模型（特别是GPT-4o）在视觉趣味性理解方面与人类评估的对齐程度，并利用其预测结果训练学习排序模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中，视觉内容的吸引力和趣味性对注意力有重要影响。随着大型多模态模型的发展，需要探索这些模型是否能够理解视觉趣味性概念，以及其预测与人类评估的一致性。

Method: 通过比较分析研究人类评估与GPT-4o预测的对齐程度，利用GPT-4o对图像对的趣味性进行标注，并将这些标注数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分对齐，GPT-4o在此概念上的表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够有效捕捉视觉趣味性概念，为深入理解人类兴趣提供了新的途径，通过知识蒸馏可以构建有效的学习排序模型。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积，显著提升推理速度和减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实证观察到代价体积在RAFT等网络的其他部分充分训练后重要性下降，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体积，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确模型达到最先进精度，速度提升1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍；最快模型能在500MB GPU内存下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 通过移除代价体积的训练策略，实现了光流估计在速度和内存效率上的显著提升，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLO的DEF-YOLO架构和首个大规模热成像隐蔽武器检测数据集TICW，通过可变形卷积和多尺度特征提取解决了热成像中隐蔽武器检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测技术存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要开发实时、低成本且保护隐私的解决方案。热成像技术具有潜力，但缺乏基准数据集。

Method: 基于YOLOv8改进的DEF-YOLO架构，在SPPF层采用可变形卷积提取多尺度特征，在骨干网络和颈部网络提取低、中、高层特征，并使用焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 建立了热成像隐蔽武器检测的新基准，提出的方法在保持速度和吞吐量的同时，能够自适应地聚焦于热成像均匀区域中的目标定位。

Conclusion: 该工作为热成像隐蔽武器检测提供了有效的解决方案和首个大规模数据集，证明了DEF-YOLO架构在该任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了Group-VQ方法，通过分组优化码本来解决VQ-VAE中的码本崩溃问题，并引入了无需训练的码本重采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE在重建任务中通过码本表示连续向量，但存在码本崩溃问题。现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，限制了码本的学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出Group-VQ方法，对码本进行分组优化，每个组独立优化，组内进行联合优化。同时引入无需训练的码本重采样方法，可在训练后调整码本大小。

Result: 在各种设置下的图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现出改进的性能，码本重采样方法实现了调整码本大小的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，无需训练的码本重采样方法提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门针对渲染视频的无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集，解决了现有方法在渲染视频上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渲染视频与相机拍摄视频存在显著差异，特别是更容易出现时间伪影，现有NR-VQA方法和数据集主要针对相机拍摄视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生有偏预测。

Method: 创建了一个大型渲染导向的视频数据集，包含多种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 与现有NR-VQA指标相比，该方法在渲染视频上表现出更优越的性能，能够有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 提出的渲染专用NR-VQA方法和数据集填补了该领域的空白，为渲染视频质量评估提供了可靠工具，在游戏、VR/AR等应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型的零样本分类中，简单的提示词比详细描述效果更好，出现了'提示过拟合'现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示词设计对视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）零样本分类的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代VLM模型，采用三层次提示词设计系统增加语言细节。

Result: 高性能模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示词效果最佳，添加描述细节会显著降低性能（准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）。低性能SigLip模型在模糊类别上使用详细提示词表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对VLM性能有重要影响，简单提示词对高性能模型更有效，而详细提示词可能更适合低性能模型处理模糊类别。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们从视觉-语言模型继承的空间推理能力有限，且需要大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中接地，这降低了训练效率且仍无法准确理解空间关系。

Method: DepthVLA采用混合变换器设计，统一了视觉-语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成一个端到端模型，明确通过预训练深度预测模块融入空间感知。

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5%进展（vs. 65.0%），在LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9%（vs. 93.6%），在Simpler模拟器中达到74.8%（vs. 58.8%），均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式集成空间感知能力，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理性能，在多种环境中都表现出色，证明了该架构的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Motivation: 现有WiFi手势识别方法存在泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题，主要由于CSI数据的域敏感性和缺乏高级手势抽象。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义，引入语义感知软监督方案编码类间相关性，最后采用鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务上均优于现有方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实世界AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的基准Spatial-DISE，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别是内在动态空间推理，并发现当前模型与人类能力存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估空间推理能力方面不足，特别是内在动态空间推理，这是人类空间认知的基本方面。

Method: 基于认知基础分类法，将任务分为四个基本象限，并开发了可扩展的自动化流水线来生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题。

Result: 评估了28个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现它们在多步骤多视图空间推理方面与人类能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健的框架、有价值的数据集和明确的方向，以实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，而忽略了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，采用GRPO强化学习框架，并探索了移除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等增强策略。

Result: 在Show-o基础模型上实现了显著改进，在标准文本到图像基准测试和偏好对齐方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习应用于掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的优化方法，在文本到图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加困难。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器实现补丁级注意力机制，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS是一种用于自动驾驶异构场景的协作感知方法，通过域分离解决特征差异问题，在保持高推理效率的同时实现检测精度与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法通常假设所有智能体使用相同的编码器，但在实际异构部署中不成立。现有方法对齐邻域特征到自车特征时容易受到域差距噪声影响，且基于transformer的域适应方法在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: 提出CoDS方法，包含两个特征对齐模块：轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)和基于域分离的分布对齐(DADS)，以及域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失函数。LSCR使用轻量卷积层对齐空间和通道维度特征，DADS通过编码器特定和编码器无关的域分离模块分别移除域依赖信息和捕获任务相关信息。

Result: 大量实验表明CoDS能有效缓解异构场景中的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间实现良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过域分离策略成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，其全卷积架构确保了高推理效率，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。需要开发能直接表征神经元对3D场景属性（如形状、姿态、光照）选择性的方法。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，参数化网格变形为径向基函数，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和缩放，同时强制几何规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法的、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的应用，比较了CNN和PLS模型，发现联合空间-光谱分析的CNN在建模化学和物理视觉信息相关参数时表现最佳，而PLS在分析样品化学参数平均含量时表现相当且更推荐使用。

Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的潜力，特别是比较深度学习方法（CNN）与传统方法（PLS）在不同分析任务中的性能差异。

Method: 通过四项研究，使用CNN（包括2D CNN和增强光谱卷积层的CNN）与PLS方法进行比较分析，涉及猪肉脂肪含量空间分布建模和大麦发芽能力预测等任务。

Result: 联合空间-光谱分析的CNN在相关参数建模中表现最优；增强光谱卷积层的2D CNN改善了PLS在化学图谱生成中的问题；PLS在化学参数平均含量分析中表现良好；大麦发芽能力预测结果不确定。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂空间-光谱分析任务中优于PLS，而PLS在简单化学参数平均分析中足够有效；开发了两个开源Python包以加速PLS建模和交叉验证。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功地将文本到视频生成与3D重建能力相结合，为文本到3D生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: 面部动作单元是增量情绪识别的有效特征，能够实现从基础情绪到复杂情绪的渐进学习，同时保持模型轻量化。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at

### [66] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM特征检测中的性能差异：传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器（SuperPoint）在FPGA上具有更好的运行性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中耗时且耗能的模块，需要研究不同硬件加速器（GPU和FPGA）在功率受限平台（如无人机）上的性能表现。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC上，比较GPU加速和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统特征检测器在GPU上表现更优，而学习型检测器SuperPoint在FPGA上可获得3.1倍运行性能提升和1.4倍能效提升。FPGA加速的V-SLAM在部分数据集上帧率更高，但GPU版本精度普遍更好。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度，为不同应用场景选择合适的硬件加速方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了基于代理的流式基准测试，研究跨文化组成和渐进模糊化如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性，发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化曲线存在不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估假设数据同质且图像质量高，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化的情况，因此需要研究跨文化组成和感知退化如何影响识别鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于代理的流式基准测试，代理在冻结的CLIP特征空间中运行，配备轻量级残差适配器。测试不同文化组成（单一文化、平衡混合、不平衡混合）和空间接触结构，环境提供按sigma调度的模糊输入。

Result: JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊时性能更高但中间阶段下降更陡峭，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。平衡混合群体缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置在高模糊下放大主要群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，量化了这些因素对性能退化的具体影响模式。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计对自动驾驶至关重要，雷达-相机融合在恶劣条件下通过提供互补的几何线索来增强鲁棒性。需要开发轻量化架构以在保持精度的同时减少计算负担。

Method: 提出XD-RCDepth轻量化架构，引入两种知识蒸馏策略：解释性对齐蒸馏（将教师的显著性结构传递给学生）和深度分布蒸馏（将深度回归重新表述为离散化区间的软分类）。

Result: 相比直接训练，平均绝对误差（MAE）降低7.97%，在nuScenes和ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上实现了具有实时效率的竞争性精度。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth通过创新的知识蒸馏策略成功实现了轻量化深度估计，在保持精度的同时显著减少参数，为自动驾驶应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Conclusion: ATR-UMOD数据集和PCDF方法为无人机全天候目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，能够适应多样化的成像条件。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

TL;DR: 提出AVAR-Net音频视觉异常识别框架，使用Wav2Vec2和MobileViT提取特征，通过早期融合和MTCN建模跨模态时序关系，在自建VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法仅依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照等挑战条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含音频特征提取器(Wav2Vec2)、视频特征提取器(MobileViT)、早期融合策略和时序模式学习网络(MTCN)，建模跨模态关系进行异常识别。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集可作为多模态异常识别研究的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了医学图像增强领域的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标，基于39篇同行评审研究，发现低对比度和噪声是最常见问题，MRI和多模态成像研究最多，而组织病理学等专业模态研究不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，限制了诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法，深度学习技术在其中发挥着越来越重要的作用。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法进行系统文献综述，分析了39篇同行评审研究，涵盖不同成像模态和各种增强方法。

Result: 发现29项研究使用传统数学方法，9项专注于深度学习技术，1项探索混合方法。在图像质量评估方面，18项研究同时使用参考和非参考指标，9项仅使用参考指标，12项仅使用非参考指标，共引入了65个IQA指标，主要是非参考指标。

Conclusion: 该综述突出了医学图像增强领域的当前局限性、研究空白和未来潜在发展方向，强调了评估指标在评估增强方法影响方面的重要性。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanvasMAR是一种新颖的视频掩码自回归模型，通过引入画布机制解决现有视频MAR模型的两个主要问题：采样初期的慢启动问题和时空维度上的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MAR模型存在慢启动问题（缺乏早期采样阶段的全局结构化先验）和时空维度上的误差累积问题，限制了视频生成的质量和效率。

Method: 提出画布机制——对下一帧的模糊全局预测，作为掩码生成的起点；引入组合式无分类器引导，联合增强空间（画布）和时间条件；采用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上表现出色，性能与基于扩散的方法相当。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频MAR模型的关键限制，实现了更快、更连贯的视频合成，在自回归模型中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的脆弱性及其异常分数的不确定性校准问题尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键应用中的可信部署。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过在冻结的DINOv2特征上附加轻量级线性头来生成对抗扰动，评估FGSM攻击效果，并使用Platt缩放进行后处理不确定性校准。

Result: 研究发现微小扰动可导致特征空间中最近邻关系翻转，造成误分类；原始异常分数校准性差；校准后验显著提高了对抗扰动输入的预测熵，降低了校准误差。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和原则性不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必备能力，研究揭示了DINOv2基检测器的具体漏洞并建立了评估基准。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视图生成和个性化定制的框架。

Conclusion: 提出的MVCustom框架成功解决了多视图生成与个性化定制的统一问题，实现了几何一致性和视角控制。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解伪影，确保真实的细节恢复，在图像超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG图构建中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniGaze是一个半监督3D视线估计框架，利用大规模无标签数据解决领域偏差问题，在跨域设置下实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法难以泛化到不同数据域，主要因为标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足

Method: 构建多样化无标签面部图像集，采用伪标签策略和奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型的语义线索计算置信度分数

Result: 在五个数据集上实现最先进性能，在跨域设置下表现优异，在四个未见数据集上展示强大的零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的视线估计方法，还能作为可扩展的数据引擎，显著提升跨域泛化性能

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

*Junhong Shen,Mu Cai,Bo Hu,Ameet Talwalkar,David A Ross,Cordelia Schmid,Alireza Fathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的代理框架，通过将视觉内容转换为可执行代码来实现可验证的多模态推理，在多个视觉推理基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表）时缺乏验证机制，像素级感知难以进行精确推理。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后通过批评器选择最忠实重建的代码，并迭代优化代码。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA和Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码进行辅助线绘制或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 解决现代深度学习架构适应fMRI数据时的输入表示问题，弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距。

Method: 将4D体积fMRI数据转换为2D fMRI活动平面图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器框架在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时fMRI数据上训练Vision Transformers。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集大小按严格幂律缩放规律提升；下游分类基准显示模型学习到丰富表示，支持跨受试者的细粒度状态解码和跨脑状态变化的受试者特定特征解码。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为fMRI数据构建基础模型的开放科学项目的一部分，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清洗流水线，通过高质量数据提升开源多模态大语言模型的性能，训练出的Bee-8B模型在多项评测中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源多模态大语言模型性能落后于闭源模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 1) 构建Honey-Data-15M数据集，包含约1500万问答对，采用多重清洗技术和新颖的双层（短和长）思维链增强策略；2) 开发HoneyPipe数据清洗流水线和DataStudio框架；3) 基于该数据集训练Bee-8B模型。

Result: Bee-8B模型在完全开源多模态大语言模型中达到新的SOTA水平，性能与半开源模型如InternVL3.5-8B相当甚至在某些方面超越。

Conclusion: 通过专注于数据质量的系统化方法，可以开发出与半开源模型具有竞争力的完全开源多模态大语言模型，为社区提供了一套基础资源。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出了KnowCoL框架，通过结合图像和文本描述在Wikidata结构化信息引导的共享语义空间中，实现开放域视觉实体识别，在零样本设置下显著提升罕见和未见实体的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、长尾分布、有限监督、视觉模糊性和语义歧义等挑战，需要处理训练时未见的大量实体。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次结构和关系上下文，在Wikidata结构化知识基础上构建共享语义空间。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，最小模型相比最先进方法在未见实体上的准确率提升10.5%，且模型尺寸小35倍。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对罕见和未见实体，证明了多模态知识融合的有效性。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉验证任务上表现不佳，与人类可靠视觉验证能力存在显著差距，需要提升多模态推理中的视觉结果验证能力。

Method: 构建ViVerBench基准评估视觉结果，设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据并训练OmniVerifier-7B，提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展范式进行迭代优化。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推动了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展的测试时优化，向更可信可控的下一代推理系统迈进。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个快速生成3D场景的生成模型，从单张图像或文本提示在几秒内生成3D场景，比之前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，而3D导向方法直接生成3D高斯表示但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在结合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持多视图导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式后训练蒸馏，将3D导向模式的分布匹配到高质量的多视图导向模式。

Result: 实验表明FlashWorld在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升视觉质量，并减少推理所需的去噪步骤，对分布外输入具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练框架，成功实现了快速、高质量的3D场景生成，在速度和渲染质量上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的新方法，用于从病理图像生成健康的反事实图像，在去除异常的同时保留个体解剖特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成健康反事实图像在医学成像中具有重要意义，可用于异常检测和为健康扫描设计的分析工具应用。现有方法难以平衡异常去除与个体特征保留。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成生成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务中优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBMs能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构的健康反事实图像，同时选择性地去除病理区域。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型在处理多模态查询时面临安全挑战，传统安全对齐方法需要大量数据集和训练成本，而推理时对齐方法存在过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 重新制定查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，基于评估的风险自适应引导激活，生成安全有用的响应。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保持模型效用的同时提高了安全性和推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，用于从脑Willis环(CoW)图像中提取中心线图和形态特征，在拓扑重建和特征提取方面表现出高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是大脑中关键的动脉网络，与脑血管疾病密切相关。虽然体素级分割是自动化评估的重要步骤，但完整的定量分析需要中心线表示。然而，传统骨架化技术因CoW复杂几何结构而难以提取可靠中心线，且公开中心线数据集稀缺。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集提取中心线图和形态特征，开发结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，在保留测试集上评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性。

Result: 基线算法在拓扑重建方面达到高精度(F1=1)，参考图和预测图之间的平均欧几里得节点距离小于一个体素。半径、长度和分叉比等特征表现出强鲁棒性，中位相对误差低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接能够实现解剖学上合理的中心线提取。研究强调需要超越简单体素测量，评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性。数据集和基线算法已发布以支持进一步方法开发和临床研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集仅限于单相机设置且通常缺乏外部真实值，需要能够严格评估多相机光场配准方法的数据集。

Method: 提供了两种互补的配准方法：基于RANSAC的交叉视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计外参6自由度位姿的光场PnP算法，两者都明确集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真实值有很强的对齐性，支持可靠的多视图光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的评估基准，两种配准方法都能实现准确且可扩展的多相机配准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖并扩展数据可用性，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度、增强细粒度结构细节并弥合图像对比度的域差距。

Method: 提出CSS-Diff框架，核心思想是在循环一致性约束下重新制定基于扩散的合成方法。包含两个新过程：切片间差距感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性；局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建来增强局部特征恢复。

Result: 在跨场合成任务上取得最先进性能（PSNR: 31.80±2.70 dB, SSIM: 0.943±0.102, LPIPS: 0.0864±0.0689）。除了像素级保真度外，还能保持细粒度解剖结构（如左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%）。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在数量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像，有效解决了低场MRI到高场MRI合成的临床保真度问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

*Tianshuo Xu,Kai Wang,Zhifei Chen,Leyi Wu,Tianshui Wen,Fei Chao,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于解决中文书法计算复制的挑战，通过联合训练识别和生成任务，在保持字符结构的同时提升页面级美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么只能生成高质量的单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。需要一种统一的方法来同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 采用统一的扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务。使用非对称噪声处理和栅格化边界框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强。框架成功扩展到其他古文字，包括甲骨文和埃及象形文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过识别和生成任务的协同训练，促进了概念级抽象，在有限数据情况下显著提升了两个任务的性能，为书法计算复制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个轻量级但功能全面的全模态模型，提供音视频理解和语音生成能力，推动下一代智能交互系统的发展。

Method: 集成视觉编码器、音频编码器、大语言模型和语音解码器，采用多阶段训练策略（预训练+后训练），并精心构建多轮训练数据集。

Result: 在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务上达到同类模型的最先进水平，4B版本性能接近7B模型，且能保留8B模型97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni为下一代智能交互系统提供了一个可访问的开源基础，在轻量级模型中实现了全面的全模态理解和生成能力。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-MMMU基准测试，系统性地评估多模态模型中视觉理解和生成能力的双向协同作用，涵盖科学、编程、数学等多个推理领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试要么孤立地评估视觉理解和生成能力，要么忽略了这两种能力内在耦合的任务，无法真正检验统一多模态模型的整合程度。

Method: 构建了包含8个推理领域的综合性基准测试，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型要么利用概念理解指导视觉合成，要么利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、纯生成模型和纯理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖性。

Conclusion: 为推进统一模型的发展提供了可靠基础，揭示了视觉理解和生成能力何时以及如何相互增强的新见解。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVC框架，用于基于扩散模型的故事延续，通过自适应视觉条件机制有效利用先前视觉上下文，同时在语义不匹配时限制其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事延续中如何有效利用先前视觉上下文并确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的核心挑战。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索最语义对齐的先前图像，当没有足够相关图像时，自适应限制先前视觉在扩散过程早期阶段的影响；通过大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集来改进数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性案例中。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，同时在语义不匹配时避免误导信息注入，实现了更好的故事延续效果。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

*Nir Goren,Oren Katzir,Abhinav Nakarmi,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级水印方案NoisePrints，利用扩散模型初始化过程中的随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，特别是当模型所有者保持模型私有且不愿或无法处理作者身份问题时，第三方验证变得必要。

Method: 利用扩散过程初始化时使用的随机种子作为水印，通过将哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保从内容中恢复有效种子不可行。同时使用密码学零知识证明来证明所有权而不泄露种子。

Result: 在多个最先进的图像和视频扩散模型上验证了NoisePrints的有效性，展示了仅使用种子和输出即可进行高效验证，无需访问模型权重。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的水印方案，能够有效保护扩散模型生成内容的版权，同时保持验证过程的轻量级和安全性。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的图像块3D表示，首次实现无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建统一的图像块3D表示，并引入GCoT数据集整合定位作为推理过程的核心组件。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，无需外部模块即可实现自回归定位，性能与最先进模型相当，并显著提升了空间推理能力。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一自包含的3D空间推理框架，通过紧密集成视觉定位和空间推理，实现了状态级性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的时空表示对视频动态建模至关重要。像素作为视频的基本单元，在时间上形成连续的3D轨迹，是动态的原始元素。

Method: 提出Trajectory Field表示法，将视频映射为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数。开发Trace Anything神经网络，通过单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场，为每个像素预测一组参数化轨迹的控制点（B样条）。

Result: 在大规模4D数据上训练，在轨迹场估计新基准上达到SOTA性能，在点追踪基准上表现竞争力；效率显著提升；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: Trajectory Field是有效的视频表示方法，Trace Anything模型通过单次预测实现高效准确的轨迹估计，具有多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域自适应方法在微调不同VLM组件时，往往导致有限的领域特定特征学习或灾难性遗忘先前能力，需要一种更高效的适应策略。

Method: VisCoP方法通过向VLM的视觉编码器添加一组紧凑的可学习视觉探针，实现高效的领域特定适应，同时最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个具有挑战性的领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标域上实现卓越性能。

Conclusion: VisCoP提供了一种有效的领域自适应方法，能够在保持源域知识的同时，显著提升模型在新域上的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉上真实的视频，但往往违反物理规律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。需要开发能生成物理合理视频的方法。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件。应用带有人类反馈的强化学习，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)端到端优化物理表征。

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其提升物理意识的能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景中。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习，为各种物理过程提供了统一的解决方案，可作为物理感知视频生成的通用即插即用方案。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多语言任务中表现出色，但在波斯语等低资源语言中的有效性需要系统评估，以填补相关研究空白。

Method: 使用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解等任务上，采用零样本和少样本学习范式，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标进行评估。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务的两种学习范式中都表现最佳，尤其在复杂推理任务中优势明显，但大多数模型在命名实体识别等token级理解任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言大语言模型在波斯语中的表现提供了重要基准，揭示了特定挑战，为未来模型开发提供了参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了5种大型语言模型在从电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能，发现BioBERT在结构化数据上表现最佳，GPT-4o在非结构化文本上表现最好，但当前性能水平仅适用于行政和研究用途，临床应用仍需人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致结构或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。尽管AI驱动的自然语言处理工具在自动化诊断分类方面有潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 评估了4种大型语言模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5）和BioBERT在分类癌症诊断方面的性能。分析了762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目）来自3456份癌症患者记录。模型测试其将诊断分类到14个预定义类别的能力，并由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码上获得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），在ICD代码准确率上与GPT-4o相当（90.8）。对于自由文本诊断，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上均优于BioBERT。GPT-3.5、Gemini和Llama在两种格式上表现较差。常见的错误分类模式包括转移瘤与中枢神经系统肿瘤的混淆，以及涉及模糊或重叠临床术语的错误。

Conclusion: 虽然当前性能水平似乎足以用于行政和研究用途，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践以及针对高风险决策的强大人工监督。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个用于评估医学AI推理稳定性的基准测试，通过仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）而保持关键症状和条件不变，来检测大型语言模型在临床决策中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床决策支持中应用日益广泛，但先前研究发现不同患者群体间存在输出差异，缺乏对受控人口统计变化下内部推理如何变化的研究。

Method: 构建MEDEQUALQA反事实基准，仅改变患者代词而保持关键症状和条件恒定，生成三个平行数据集（共约69,000项），使用GPT-4.1模型并通过语义文本相似性（STS）评估推理轨迹的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示整体相似性较高（平均STS>0.80），但在引用风险因素、指南锚点和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。错误分析揭示了可能导致不公平护理的临床相关偏见位点。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA为审计医学AI推理稳定性提供了一个受控的诊断环境，有助于识别可能影响公平护理的推理偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具配置复杂耗时，需要专业知识，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程

Method: 采用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法，结合话语分解、分类器和阶段特定few-shot提示来准确预测阶段，然后通过边缘预测连接非线性工作流，从子话语上下文推断阶段属性

Result: 相比强基线方法，CAG在准确性和效率方面表现更好，同时显著减少token使用量，能够端到端生成工作流并包含稳健验证步骤

Conclusion: 这是首个在自然语言驱动ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边缘布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释性等优势

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

*Thao Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了前沿LLM代理在战略欺骗方面的能力和倾向，通过两种博弈论框架测试发现，即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其战略欺骗能力变得至关重要，而LLM之间的欺骗行为研究尚不充分。

Method: 使用廉价谈话信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈两种博弈论框架，测试了GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-pro、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Llama-3.3-70b四个模型，通过思维链推理分析欺骗策略。

Result: 在提示下，大多数模型特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet达到接近完美的表现。无提示时，所有模型在同行评估中都选择欺骗而非坦白（100%），在廉价谈话中选择欺骗的模型成功率高达95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险博弈论场景进行稳健评估的必要性。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个用于多轮Text-to-SQL的代理训练框架，通过马尔可夫决策过程实现迭代式的执行-验证-精炼循环，显著提升了对话连贯性和SQL可执行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单的文本翻译任务，缺乏执行验证和显式精炼，导致生成不可执行或不连贯的SQL查询。

Method: 将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，代理与数据库和执行反馈交互，使用持久对话内存进行连贯性验证，执行迭代式的提议-执行-验证-精炼循环。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1持续优于强基线方法，证明了环境驱动验证和内存引导精炼的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过环境驱动的验证和内存引导的精炼，MTSQL-R1为对话式语义解析提供了有效的解决方案，强调了长期规划在复杂对话任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为需要内化培训的人类标注者设计的，而大语言模型需要明确、结构化的指令，因此需要开发专门的方法来重新利用现有指南。

Method: 提出了一种面向调节的指南重新利用方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统标注指南转化为适合LLM的清晰指令。使用NCBI疾病语料库作为案例研究。

Result: 实验表明重新利用的指南能够有效指导LLM标注者，同时揭示了若干实际挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力支持可扩展且成本效益高的标注指南精炼和自动化标注工作流程。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型(A²FM)，通过路由-对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM分为推理型和代理型两类，各自训练目标不同导致优势不匹配，在简单查询上效率低下，存在过度推理或过度调用工具的问题。

Method: 采用路由-对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式处理简单查询；提出自适应策略优化(APO)进行自适应采样和成本正则化奖励。

Result: 在32B规模上，A²FM在BrowseComp、AIME25和HLE基准测试中分别达到13.4%、70.4%和16.7%，创下可比模型的新SOTA；自适应执行每个正确答案成本仅0.00487美元，相比推理型和代理型分别降低45.2%和33.5%成本。

Conclusion: A²FM框架成功统一了推理型和代理型LLM的优势，在保持相当准确性的同时显著提升了成本效率，实现了更高效的适应性执行。

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Result: 在聚合的人工标注基准测试中，FastFact在效率和效果上均优于现有基线，与人工评估对齐度最高

Conclusion: FastFact框架能够高效可靠地评估长文本LLM生成的事实性，解决了现有方法的效率和证据不足问题

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为VLURes的多语言基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语四种语言下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含八个任务和一个新颖的不相关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语为中心的基准测试，且图像-文本对通常包含短文本。为了评估VLM在多语言长文本环境下的细粒度能力，需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中策划数据集，涵盖十个不同的图像类别和丰富的文本上下文，通过提示VLM生成响应和推理，进行自动评估和母语者评估。

Result: 评估了十个VLM，表现最好的GPT-4o模型总体准确率达到90.8%，但仍比人类表现低6.7%。开源模型与人类表现的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes基准测试在开发能够处理多模态视觉推理的智能代理方面发挥着关键作用，揭示了不同语言和任务之间的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个统一的自适应效率框架，为延迟敏感的NLP任务提供动态计算能力，并作为社区工具促进自适应transformer的进一步研究。

Method: 结合渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出三种技术，提供开源基准测试流水线，在GLUE任务（SST-2、QQP、MNLI）上自动化数据处理、计时和消融实验。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中组合这些机制可能会增加延迟，但在SST-2上EAT比优化的DistilBERT基线实现了稍高的准确率，展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力。

Conclusion: 主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的框架，包含脚本、CSV日志和分析工具，旨在作为社区工具用于自适应transformer的进一步研究。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

Motivation: 现代数字技术虽然提供了前所未有的教育机会，但现有的古兰经诵读自动评估工具未能实现广泛采用或教学有效性，存在数据依赖、人口偏见等问题。

Method: 通过对过去20年学术研究、网络平台和商业应用的全面分析，批判了基于自动语音识别的数据驱动方法，提出基于规则的知识驱动计算框架。

Result: 分析发现现有方法存在根本性错位，建议转向基于预期声学建模的混合系统，结合深度语言知识和先进音频分析。

Conclusion: 古兰经自动评估的未来在于集成深度语言知识与先进音频分析的混合系统，能够提供稳健、公平且教学合理的工具来支持全球学习者。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育领域的重要性日益增长，需要专门的师生对话基准来评估其教学能力，现有的多轮对话基准不足以满足教育场景的需求。

Method: 构建EduDial数据集，基于Bloom教育目标分类法和十种提问策略（包括情境提问、最近发展区提问、元认知提问等），为不同认知水平的学生设计差异化教学策略。训练EduDial-LLM 32B模型，并建立11维评估框架。

Result: 实验在17个主流LLM上进行，结果显示大多数模型在以学生为中心的教学场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EduDial为评估LLMs的教学能力提供了全面基准，EduDial-LLM在师生对话场景中表现出色，证明了专门针对教育场景训练模型的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs应该基于客观知识真实回答事实性问题，而不受用户个人背景或系统个性化影响。现有研究主要关注对抗性输入，但缺乏对真实用户交互中常见个人信息的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 通过评估LLMs对询问角色（用户身份、专业背景、信念等属性）的响应，分析用户框架信息如何影响事实性问答的准确性。

Result: 研究发现询问角色线索会显著改变问答准确性，并触发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等故障模式，表明模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性。

Conclusion: 询问角色测试是评估LLMs鲁棒性的有效工具，模型对用户框架的敏感性会威胁事实回答的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在好奇心方面的研究不足，特别是在跨文化语境中，需要探索LLMs在不同文化背景下的好奇心表现。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，引入CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、话题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机对齐度。

Result: 发现LLMs会削弱跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%；证明了好奇心对LLMs跨文化适应性的实际价值。

Conclusion: 好奇心对于LLMs的跨文化适应性具有重要价值，是未来NLP研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入一个中间限定模型来改进推测解码，解决了草稿模型大小与令牌接受率之间的权衡问题，实现了更高的生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准推测解码面临草稿模型大小与令牌接受率的根本权衡：较小的草稿模型生成令牌更快但与目标模型的分布差异更大，导致接受率降低和加速效果减弱。

Method: 引入中间限定模型来弥合草稿模型和目标模型之间的输出预测分布差距，采用分层解码策略和模糊接受标准，支持每个阶段的宽松发散阈值。

Result: PyramidSD 相比标准推测解码实现了最高1.91倍的生成速度提升，在消费级GPU上达到124 tokens/秒。在1B参数草稿模型和8B目标模型的小内存设置中，以最小目标模型质量损失换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD 提供了一种实用的方法来增强推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有的推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

TL;DR: LLM能够生成针对特定人口属性的个性化虚假信息，即使简单的个性化策略也会显著增加模型越狱的可能性，并增强虚假信息的说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM生成个性化虚假信息的能力，评估现有安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性，填补关于说服力和个性化虚假信息生成的研究空白。

Method: 采用红队方法，使用324个虚假信息叙事和150个不同人物档案作为提示，在8个最先进的LLM上生成约160万条多语言文本，创建AI-TRAITS数据集。

Result: 个性化提示显著提高了所有测试LLM的越狱率，改变了语言和修辞模式，并增强了虚假信息的说服力。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的LLM存在严重漏洞，个性化策略会绕过安全机制，需要改进多语言和跨人口统计环境下的安全对齐和检测策略。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，约束更新位于前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中，保留预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大型语言模型时存在灾难性遗忘问题，学习更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主导奇异方向。

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用投影矩阵P_L = I - U_k U_k^⊤和P_R = I - V_k V_k^⊤约束LoRA更新完全位于前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成任务上的广泛实验表明，OPLoRA显著减少遗忘，同时在LLaMA-2 7B和Qwen2.5 7B上保持竞争力的任务特定性能。

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保留的有效机制，为知识保留提供了数学保证。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习评估缺乏对人类发展轨迹的模拟，需要系统性和细粒度的方法来评估模型逐步获取新技能的能力。

Method: 构建涵盖5-10岁五个发展阶段的技能图谱，生成包含段落、理解问答、技能测试问答和指令-响应对的23.4B标记合成数据集，使用1.35亿参数Transformer在独立、联合和顺序设置下训练。

Result: 展示了技能保持和迁移效率之间的权衡，支持对遗忘、前向迁移和后向迁移的精确分析。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖关系的细粒度控制，这项工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差（PVar）对直接偏好优化（DPO）训练效果的影响，发现高PVar的提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而更有效地训练语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高昂且效率低下，需要减少所需标注的方法。偏好方差可能影响DPO训练的有效性。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数的上界，证明其受PVar控制。使用奖励模型生成的偏好微调LLM，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上评估。

Result: 实验表明高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示。使用较小奖励模型（1B、3B）进行选择时，PVar方法依然稳健。在UltraFeedback数据集上，仅使用前10%高PVar提示训练的模型性能优于使用全数据集。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例以进行高效LLM对齐的重要指标，高PVar提示能显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: GatePro是一种无需参数的MoE专家选择多样性提升方法，通过识别相似专家对并引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家同时激活，提高模型有效容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构中功能相似的专家经常被同时选择，导致计算冗余和有效模型容量受限，现有平衡损失方法未能解决专家多样性问题。

Method: GatePro识别最相似的专家对，引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家共同激活，同时保持专家自然专业化。无需额外可学习参数，可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署。

Result: 综合评估表明GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中均有效，能显著提升专家多样性，使专家发展出更独特和互补的能力。

Conclusion: GatePro提供了一种实用的解决方案来提升MoE有效性，通过促进专家选择多样性避免功能冗余，且部署灵活无需额外参数。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Motivation: 大语言模型的不确定性量化具有挑战性，现有方法难以有效衡量模型可靠性。从因果视角建立模型不确定性与语义保持不变性之间的联系。

Method: 灰色盒不确定性量化方法，通过语义保持干预（如改写、翻译等）前后模型输出的变化来测量不确定性，提供认识不确定性的有效估计。

Result: 在多种大语言模型和问答数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和计算效率方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了新的因果视角，既能有效估计认识不确定性，又具有计算效率优势。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验在医学进步中至关重要，但需要包含具有适当和多样化医疗背景的参与者。自动化资格评估可以改进研究效率。

Method: 结合特征提取方法（Word2Vec、命名实体识别）和传统向量化技术（计数向量化、TF-IDF），探索加权TF-IDF词嵌入，使用随机森林和SVM进行多标签分类，评估TextRank、Luhn和GPT-3等摘要技术。

Result: 通过ROUGE分数评估证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了使用数据驱动方法自动化临床试验资格评估的潜力，从而提高了研究效率。

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: 当前LLM的单次预测准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究这两方面因素对集成性能的影响。

Method: 比较两种单次策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出）和随机采样示例（基线），同时变化采样温度来调节输出多样性。

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提升7.6%，RMSE降低10.5%；且超过5次提示方法：宏F1提升21.1%，RMSE降低24.0%。

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择和增加温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，强调了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效单次LLM集成中的实际重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在当前AI评估中代表性不足，需要专门基准来评估LLMs与该地区文化和价值观的对齐程度。

Method: 基于大规模人类调查构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中性、个性化、第三方文化观察者）和两种语言模式（英语和本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现跨语言价值偏移、推理导致文化对齐恶化、隐藏偏好等关键现象，模型在本地语言中会将多样化国家简化为单一实体。

Conclusion: MENAValues为诊断文化错位提供了可扩展框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供了实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

Conclusion: Mirror-SD通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理的组合策略，将推测解码推向高接受率低开销的理想状态，显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于图的抽象代码生成的表示学习奠定了基础，强调了表示方法在此类生成任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

Motivation: 传统思维链蒸馏在科学领域效果不佳，因为即使是先进大模型也经常产生错误或肤浅的推理。直接蒸馏这些有缺陷的输出会导致低质量训练数据，限制学生模型的性能。

Method: 1) 从多个LLM构建多样化推理轨迹池；2) 用自动检索的领域知识丰富推理；3) 通过新颖性驱动选择、反思性重组和变异迭代优化轨迹；4) 使用评估答案正确性、连贯性和知识利用的适应度函数指导优化。

Conclusion: CoT-Evo建立了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化和易出错的大模型中合成高保真度的科学推理数据。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing

TL;DR: 本文首次从人类推理理论角度系统综述了思维链微调技术，基于六顶思考帽框架对现有方法进行分类分析，并指出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链微调研究主要关注技术层面，缺乏从人类推理机制角度的系统分析。鉴于思维链微调的最终目标是让大语言模型像人类一样推理，从认知角度研究这一技术至关重要。

Method: 基于著名的六顶思考帽框架，对思维链微调方法进行分类和检验，该框架使用六种隐喻帽子系统化地表征常见的人类思维模式。

Result: 提供了现有数据集和模型性能的全面概述，并维护了一个实时GitHub仓库持续跟踪该领域的最新进展。

Conclusion: 这项调查有望成为有价值的资源，激发这一快速发展领域的创新和进步。

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码实现LLM去毒，无需参数微调，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法依赖外部约束，需要额外资源且损失生成流畅性，需要更轻量高效的解决方案

Method: DSCD方法在输出生成时加强安全层的内部下一个token分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布

Result: 在代表性开源LLM和公共数据集上的实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面达到SOTA性能，且效率优于现有方法

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量、高兼容性和即插即用能力，可作为LLM安全部署的实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLMs中的对抗性攻击，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具有强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过良性提示中隐藏有害目标的对抗性输入。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，通过明确的动作（阻止、重构、转发）来防御攻击，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLMs上，SHIELD持续降低了越狱和不遵循率，同时保持了实用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个即插即用的实用安全补丁，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLMs，具有可忽略的开销且易于扩展到新的攻击类型。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在检索增强生成(RAG)中，检索文档的上下文格式（如分隔符、结构标记等表面选择）对模型准确性和稳定性有显著影响，即使语义内容相同。作者提出了上下文归一化策略来标准化上下文表示，提高RAG的鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，而检索文档的上下文格式如何影响模型性能这一问题尚未得到充分探索。作者发现即使语义内容相同，不同的上下文格式也会导致显著的性能差异。

Method: 设计了控制实验来研究上下文密度、分隔符样式和位置放置的影响，并基于这些洞察提出了上下文归一化策略——一种轻量级的方法，在生成前自适应地标准化上下文表示。

Result: 在受控和真实世界RAG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的策略能够持续提高对顺序变化的鲁棒性，并增强长上下文利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅依赖于检索正确的内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式。这项研究为更好的长上下文推理提供了新的经验证据和实用技术。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的跨语言重音转换的语音翻译系统，通过可控制的TTS模型保留词级重音，解决了数据稀缺问题并实现了有效的韵律保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音翻译系统往往忽略韵律信息，特别是词级重音，导致翻译结果缺乏情感表达和说话者意图。需要一种能够有效保留副语言线索的翻译方法。

Method: 利用LLM进行跨语言重音转换，将源语言重音转换为目标语言标签，指导可控TTS模型生成。开发自动生成对齐训练数据的流程，并引入"LLM-as-Judge"评估机制。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保留重音方面显著优于基线方法，同时保持了相当的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度。

Conclusion: 强调了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为语音翻译中副语言线索的保留提供了有效且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

TL;DR: 提出Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK)方法，将高维密集嵌入映射到低维稀疏表示，在保持异常检测性能的同时显著降低计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成的高维密集嵌入在文本异常检测中面临的内存需求大和计算时间长的挑战。

Method: 引入简化的隔离核(SIK)，通过边界聚焦的特征映射将高维密集嵌入转换为低维稀疏表示，具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK在检测性能上优于11种最先进的异常检测算法，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK方法有效解决了高维嵌入带来的计算挑战，在文本异常检测中实现了更好的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LLM引导的合成增强方法(LGSA)，使用大语言模型生成反事实样本来缓解AI系统中的偏见问题，在保持准确性的同时减少性能差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统中的偏见问题引发伦理和实践担忧，传统公平方法依赖受保护属性标签、涉及准确性与公平性的权衡，且难以跨数据集泛化

Method: 使用大语言模型生成性别互换的反事实示例，通过结构化提示创建性别转换的释义，并进行语义相似性检查、属性验证、毒性筛选和人工抽查等质量控制

Result: LGSA将准确率提升至99.1%，偏见差距降至1.9%，而基线模型准确率为96.7%且偏见差距为7.2%。简单交换增强方法将偏见差距降至0.7%但准确率降至95.6%

Conclusion: LGSA是一种有效的偏见缓解策略，能在保持高任务准确性和标签保真度的同时增强子群体平衡

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球语言多样性导致高质量数字语言资源分布不均，限制了大多数人口获得技术福利。缺乏数据资源使得低资源语言的NLP任务难以进行。

Method: 使用图像和文本分析技术，从报纸文章中自动提取双语平行语料库，该方法具有可扩展性和完全自动化特性。

Result: 为两种不同语言组合构建了平行数据语料库，通过机器翻译任务验证，比当前基线提高了近3个BLEU分数。

Abstract: Linguistic diversity across the world creates a disparity with the
availability of good quality digital language resources thereby restricting the
technological benefits to majority of human population. The lack or absence of
data resources makes it difficult to perform NLP tasks for low-resource
languages. This paper presents a novel scalable and fully automated methodology
to extract bilingual parallel corpora from newspaper articles using image and
text analytics. We validate our approach by building parallel data corpus for
two different language combinations and demonstrate the value of this dataset
through a downstream task of machine translation and improve over the current
baseline by close to 3 BLEU points.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了层次频率标记探针（HFTP），通过频域分析识别LLMs和人类大脑中处理句法结构的组件，发现LLMs与人类大脑在句法处理上存在相似性和差异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否使用类似人类大脑的机制来处理句法结构，以及LLMs行为能力的计算模块来源。

Method: 使用层次频率标记探针（HFTP）进行频域分析，识别LLMs中的神经元组件和人类大脑皮层区域对句法结构的编码。

Result: GPT-2、Gemma、Llama等模型在相似层处理句法，而人类大脑依赖不同皮层区域；LLM表示与大脑左半球更相似；模型升级趋势不同：Gemma 2更接近大脑，Llama 3.1则偏离。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，揭示了LLM行为改进的机制可能并非完全人类化，为模型可解释性提供新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Concept游戏作为评估LLMs溯因推理能力的基准，发现LLMs在需要理解他人战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正假设的任务上表现不佳，且在多语言环境下性能进一步下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLMs抽象推理能力时存在局限性，特别是当任务涉及网格、符号或视觉模式等与LLMs预训练数据不同的表示形式时。

Method: 引入Concept单词猜测棋盘游戏作为基准，该游戏使用更接近LLM预训练数据的自然语言表示，并在多语言环境下评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 人类成功率超过90%，而最先进的LLMs成功率不超过40%。在多语言评估中，LLMs在低资源语言（荷兰语、法语、西班牙语）中的表现比英语更差。

Conclusion: Concept游戏有效暴露了LLMs在溯因推理方面的根本弱点，特别是在理解战略意图和动态信息更新方面，且这种弱点在多语言环境中更加明显。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的搜索代理方法虽然提升了问答基准性能，但忽视了中间推理步骤的质量，可能导致思维链不忠实的问题。

Method: 提出VERITAS框架，在强化学习过程中整合三种忠实度指标的信息-思维、思维-答案和思维-搜索忠实度奖励。

Result: 使用VERITAS训练的模型在七个问答基准上不仅显著提高了推理忠实度，还实现了可比较的任务性能。

Conclusion: VERITAS框架有效解决了RL搜索代理的推理忠实度问题，为开发更可靠的检索增强生成系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了In-Distribution Steering (IDS)方法，通过基于输入数据在表示空间中的分布来动态调整干预强度，解决了现有激活引导方法使用固定强度导致控制不足或文本质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用固定干预强度，导致要么控制不足，要么过度干预破坏文本的合理性和连贯性。

Method: IDS方法根据输入数据在表示空间中的分布情况动态调整干预强度，当输入离分布较远时增强干预，在分布内时减弱干预，实现自适应干预和生成稳定性。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上达到高准确率，同时生成连贯文本且避免崩溃，特别适合实际应用。

Conclusion: IDS通过动态调整干预强度，在保持文本质量的同时有效控制LLM行为，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应CFG方案来解决AR TTS模型中风格-内容不匹配问题，通过根据检测到的不匹配程度调整CFG参数，在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时提升情感表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当期望的情感（风格提示）与文本语义内容冲突时，TTS系统会产生不自然的语音，这削弱了细粒度情感控制的目标。现有CFG技术在AR TTS模型中的应用不足，可能导致音频质量下降。

Method: 提出自适应CFG方案，使用大型语言模型或自然语言推理模型检测风格-内容不匹配程度，并根据不同不匹配水平调整CFG参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，自适应CFG方案在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时，显著提升了AR TTS模型的情感表达能力。

Conclusion: 自适应CFG方案有效解决了AR TTS模型中的风格-内容不匹配问题，实现了更好的情感控制效果。

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and

### [144] [LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13302)
*Pablo Miralles-González,Javier Huertas-Tato,Alejandro Martín,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM预训练和上下文学习能力的无监督方法，通过测量文本间的风格可转移性来解决作者身份问题，在控制主题相关性时优于对比训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算风格学在身份链接和剽窃检测等应用中存在将风格与主题混淆的问题，而现代LLM的CLM预训练在通用作者身份问题中很少被利用。

Method: 利用LLM的广泛预训练和上下文学习能力，使用LLM的对数概率来测量从一个文本到另一个文本的风格可转移性。

Result: 该方法显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率，性能随基础模型大小和测试时计算量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在作者身份验证中实现了计算成本与准确率之间的灵活权衡，展示了LLM预训练在风格分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

*Simon Lupart,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理来适应动态对话场景，使用意图感知奖励解决稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随时间演变，话语通常不完整，需要上下文解释、查询重构以及检索与生成的动态协调，静态的'重写、检索、生成'流水线无法满足需求。

Method: 基于强化学习的推理框架，交错进行搜索和推理，提出意图感知奖励机制提供回合级反馈，使检索和推理与用户目标对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现优异，在五个CQA数据集上超越竞争模型，涵盖话题转移、意图演变、混合主动对话和多文档基础等场景。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流水线实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，能够鲁棒地泛化到不同领域。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EBCAR，一种轻量级的重排序框架，通过增强跨段落理解来解决RAG系统中需要跨段落推理的检索挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重排序方法虽然使用强大语言模型，但忽略了跨段落推理的挑战，如指代消解、实体消歧和跨多源证据聚合。

Method: EBCAR直接在检索段落的嵌入上操作，通过段落结构信息和混合注意力机制增强跨段落理解，捕获文档间高层交互和文档内低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中，EBCAR在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务上表现出色，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有SOTA重排序器。

Conclusion: EBCAR有效解决了RAG系统中跨段落推理的检索挑战，在保持轻量级的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

*Yuan Feng,Haoyu Guo,JunLin Lv,S. Kevin Zhou,Xike Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DefensiveKV和Layer-DefensiveKV方法，通过防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，显著降低KV缓存的内存和运行时开销，同时最小化生成质量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于稳定性假设（固定子集在生成过程中始终重要），使用均值聚合，但该假设本质脆弱，在极端情况下容易失效。

Method: 采用两步骤线性时间防御性聚合策略，控制最坏情况风险。DefensiveKV及其扩展Layer-DefensiveKV结合分层预算分配。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，在20%缓存大小下，分别将生成质量损失减少2.3倍和4.3倍，相比最强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过最坏情况风险管理优化缓存驱逐开辟了有前景的方向，建立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

*Katerina Korre,John Pavlopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用NLP技术分析希腊谚语情感分布，通过LLM进行情感分类，发现希腊大部分地区负面情感谚语更普遍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全球谚语景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感特征，由于口头传统导致许多文化智慧未被充分研究

Method: 使用LLM进行谚语情感分类，扩展希腊谚语数据集包含方言，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析

Result: LLM能准确识别谚语情感，特别是作为非常规情感极性任务时；希腊大部分地区负面情感谚语更普遍

Conclusion: NLP方法能有效分析谚语情感分布，希腊谚语整体偏向负面情感

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Protect是一个原生多模态护栏模型，专为企业级部署设计，能够无缝处理文本、图像和音频输入，在毒性、性别歧视、数据隐私和提示注入四个安全维度上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监控、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足受监管环境的需求。

Method: 采用基于低秩适应(LoRA)的微调特定类别适配器，在广泛的多模态数据集上进行训练，并通过教师辅助标注流程生成高质量上下文感知标签。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有安全维度上均达到最先进性能，超越了WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1等现有开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: Protect为可信赖、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够跨文本、图像和音频模态运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

TL;DR: 分析联邦学习环境下ASR模型对属性推断攻击的脆弱性，发现仅通过权重差异就能推断敏感属性如性别、年龄、口音等，其中口音信息最容易被推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但ASR模型在联邦设置下可能存在被攻击者通过权重差异推断敏感属性的风险。

Method: 在被动威胁模型下，使用非参数白盒攻击方法，仅基于权重差异对Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三个ASR模型进行攻击测试。

Result: 攻击成功推断出性别、年龄、口音、情绪和构音障碍等敏感属性，其中口音信息在所有模型中都可靠地被推断。预训练数据中代表性不足或缺失的属性更容易受到此类攻击。

Conclusion: 联邦ASR模型存在先前未记录的脆弱性，为改进安全性提供了见解。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-SMART是一个模型无关的框架，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来维护多轮对话的一致性，显著提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多轮对话中存在的逻辑不一致和事实衰减问题，现有方法如RAG和agentic working memories仍依赖静态知识源，无法适应动态变化的对话上下文。

Method: 提出D-SMART框架，包含两个协同组件：动态结构化记忆(DSM)增量构建和维护对话的知识图谱，推理树(RT)在图上执行可追踪的多步推理。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，D-SMART显著优于现有方法，将对话一致性分数提升超过48%，并将开源模型的质量分数提升高达10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过动态结构化表示和显式推理有效解决了多轮对话中的一致性问题，并提出了新的NLI-based评估指标来更好地衡量对话一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

including agent-based approaches and document-specific foundation models. This
paper aims to provide a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in DAI and
its implications for both academic and practical applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在单轮对话中使用贝叶斯说服框架来增强大语言模型的战略说服能力，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者明确描述信息模式，引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的战略使用或依赖强假设。需要探索更有效的自然语言说服策略。

Method: 提出两种贝叶斯说服方法：半正式自然语言和全自然语言，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者明确描述其潜在类型，引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。

Result: 实验表明：1）基于贝叶斯说服策略的LLM比非贝叶斯基线获得更高成功率；2）半正式方法更具可信度和逻辑性，全自然语言方法情感共鸣更强；3）经过微调的小模型能达到与大模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效提升LLM的战略说服能力，不同方法各有优势，且模型规模不是性能的决定性因素。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了生成代理模型Concordia和GPT-4在模拟真实世界环境中模拟心理理论的能力，发现GPT-4在基于信念归因选择行动方面存在严重局限，表明其表面上的心理理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联而非真正推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成代理模型是否能在模拟环境中有效建模心理理论，并评估GPT-4是否能从社会情境中进行真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理模型Concordia框架，在模拟真实世界环境中评估GPT-4的心理理论能力，特别关注其基于信念归因的行动选择和从社会情境中推理的能力。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，在生成连贯的因果效应方面存在困难，表明其心理理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联而非真正推理。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了当前关于LLMs中涌现心理理论能力的说法，强调需要更严格、基于行动的评价框架。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

Method: 使用系统发育比较模型分析南岛语系、印欧语系和乌拉尔语系的词典数据，评估关联性、借用性和使用频率三个预测因子

Result: 关联度高的概念对在语系中同形表达范围更广且变化速率较慢；高频和易借用概念对变化更快且较少同形表达；不同语系间存在显著差异

Conclusion: 概念关联度促进同形表达的稳定性和持久性，而使用频率和借用性加速变化，区域和文化因素在意义演变中起重要作用

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches:
native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their
trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a
comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法在机器翻译中存在两个主要限制：(1)质量评估模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷，忽略了关键错误如翻译幻觉；(2)数据利用效率低，只选择单一胜负对而丢弃了有价值的学习信号。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架，包含：1)多视角奖励引擎，结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分；2)多对构造策略，从所有翻译候选中系统性地创建全面的偏好对集合。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有大型语言模型表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过多视角奖励和多对学习策略，实现了更稳健和忠实的翻译，解决了现有偏好优化方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了LiteraryQA，这是NarrativeQA的一个高质量子集，专注于文学作品，通过人工和LLM验证的流程清理了低质量QA样本和文档噪音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NarrativeQA作为叙事文本问答领域最广泛使用的基准，其可靠性受到噪音文档和有缺陷的QA对的限制，需要构建更高质量的基准。

Method: 使用人工和LLM验证的流程识别和修正低质量QA样本，同时从源文档中移除无关文本，并对自动评估指标进行元评估。

Result: 分析显示所有基于n-gram的指标在系统级别与人类判断相关性低，而LLM-as-a-Judge评估（即使使用小型开源模型）能与人类排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA提供了一个更可靠的叙事文本问答基准，LLM评估方法优于传统指标，为长上下文LLM在文学QA任务上的评估提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

TL;DR: 提出了首个动态实时评估基准\bench，专门用于评估大语言模型在消费者领域的人类意图理解能力，填补了该领域缺乏大规模基准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的公共讨论（如消费者产品讨论）具有多源、冲突、动态等复杂特性，现有基准无法有效评估LLM在这种复杂环境下的意图理解能力。

Method: 构建了最大且最多样化的动态实时评估基准\bench，通过自动化策展管道支持实时更新并防止数据污染。

Result: \bench是同类基准中规模最大、多样性最高的，能够有效评估LLM在复杂公共讨论中的意图理解能力。

Conclusion: \bench基准为评估LLM在真实世界人类意图理解方面的能力提供了重要工具，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

Conclusion: MedREK框架有效解决了医疗LLMs知识更新问题，为医疗领域的高风险应用提供了可行的编辑方案，特别是在批量编辑方面取得了突破

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

Motivation: LLM的推理模式不透明，传统强化学习对整段生成内容给予统一奖励，无法区分关键步骤和常规步骤。

Method: 1. 区分局部和全局注意力头；2. 提出窗口平均注意力距离和未来注意力影响两个指标；3. 识别预规划-锚定机制；4. 开发三种针对性RL策略对关键节点进行信用分配。

Result: 提出的RL策略在各种推理任务中取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，将不透明的优化转变为可操作的结构感知过程，为LLM推理的透明和有效优化提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在不同语言间表现不均衡，高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距，需要提升在低资源语言上的表现

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵识别语言特定神经元，仅对这些神经元相关的权重进行目标语言数据的微调

Result: 在12种中低资源语言上的实验表明，该方法在仅更新最多1%参数的情况下，性能优于全参数微调、FFN-only微调、LoRA适配和随机子集微调等基线

Conclusion: 该方法为将最先进模型适配到低资源语言提供了一条成本效益高的路径，并发布了100多种语言的语言特定神经元识别结果

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准测试存在LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡问题，且非英语数据集有限。

Method: 从维基百科实时收集表格数据，支持英语、德语、俄语和法语等多语言，创建领域平衡的基准测试。

Result: LLM从新收集表格生成的见解在自动指标上表现较差，但LLM和人工评估未显示明显差异；领域效应在所有评估中都很明显。

Conclusion: FreshTab能有效解决数据污染问题，领域平衡的基准测试更具挑战性，多语言支持扩展了评估范围。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然节省内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减少，限制了GPU批处理大小和解码吞吐量，尤其是在大规模批处理推理中。

Method: NOSA将令牌选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束，减少CPU和GPU间的KV传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持接近无损性能的同时，相比基准方法(InfLLM-V2)实现了最高2.3倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: NOSA通过显式局部性约束有效解决了KV缓存卸载问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了解码效率。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

TL;DR: 该研究通过基于公开数据集的指令微调，显著提升了开源大语言模型在德语肿瘤诊断文本编码中的准确性，ICD-10-GM精确编码准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国医疗环境中需要准确使用ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3进行肿瘤诊断编码，开源小模型在德语环境下编码准确率较低，需要探索提升其性能的方法。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建了超过50万个问答对作为训练数据，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行指令微调。

Result: 微调后ICD-10-GM精确编码准确率提升至41-58%，部分编码准确率提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率也有提升但较低；模型大小与准确率正相关，但微调后大小模型差距缩小。

Conclusion: 利用公开目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的性能，为隐私保护的自动化医疗编码提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

Motivation: 大型语言模型在时间理解方面存在困难，特别是在涉及多实体、复合运算符和演化事件序列的问题时。现有基于时间知识图谱的方法在保持时间忠实性、多实体时间同步、适应不同时间运算符和重用先前推理经验方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出MemoTime框架：将复杂时间问题分解为时间树层次结构，实现运算符感知推理；采用动态证据检索层选择运算符特定的检索策略；建立自演进经验记忆存储已验证的推理轨迹、工具包决策和子问题嵌入。

Result: 在多个时间QA基准测试中达到最先进结果，比强基线提升高达24.0%；使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习有效解决了时间推理中的关键挑战，显著提升了LLM的时间理解能力，并使小模型也能获得强大的时间推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音适应LLMs在语言理解任务中表现不如文本LLMs的问题，即文本-语音理解差距。现有方法依赖大规模语音合成或专有数据集，需要更数据高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，结合跨模态蒸馏和针对性合成数据，通过主动选择学习来改善对齐同时减轻遗忘。

Result: 在3B和7B LLMs上，SALAD在知识、语言理解和推理等广泛领域基准测试中，使用比公开语料库少一个数量级的语音数据，取得了与强开放权重模型相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: SALAD通过分析文本-语音理解差距的两个驱动因素（遗忘和跨模态不对齐），提供了一种数据高效的方法来缩小这一差距，在减少数据需求的同时保持竞争力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To

TL;DR: 提出了GAPS框架，一个多维度的AI临床医生系统评估范式，涵盖认知深度(G)、答案完整性(A)、鲁棒性(P)和安全(S)，并通过自动化流程构建基准测试，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题或人工评分的AI临床医生系统基准测试无法捕捉真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发了全自动的指南锚定流程，构建证据邻域，创建双图树表示，自动生成跨G级别的问题，使用DeepResearch代理合成GRADE一致的评分标准，并由LLM评委进行评分。

Result: 验证确认自动生成的问题质量高且与临床医生判断一致。评估发现最先进模型存在关键失败模式：推理深度增加时性能急剧下降，答案完整性不足，对对抗性扰动高度脆弱，存在安全隐患。

Conclusion: 这种自动化、临床基础的方法为严格评估AI临床医生系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

*Ivan Vykopal,Matúš Pikuliak,Simon Ostermann,Marián Šimko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat等聊天助手在搜索行为中的来源可信度和回答依据性，发现Perplexity在来源可信度方面表现最佳，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上更倾向于引用低可信度来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天助手集成网络搜索功能，虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也存在放大低可信度来源错误信息的风险，需要系统评估其搜索行为。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个易传播错误信息话题的声明，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat的来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。

Result: 不同助手之间存在差异，Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上更频繁地引用非可信来源。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统比较了常用聊天助手的事实核查行为，为在高风险信息环境中评估AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

*Zhiqi Huang,Vivek Datla,Chenyang Zhu,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu,Anoop Kumar,Ritesh Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于前馈网络激活的置信度估计方法，用于检索增强生成系统，在金融客服场景中优于基线方法，并保持低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如金融和医疗中，错误答案的代价远高于不回答问题，因此需要准确的置信度估计来确保RAG系统的可靠性。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号，避免投影和softmax归一化造成的信息损失；将置信度预测建模为序列分类任务，使用Huber损失进行正则化训练以提高对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实金融行业客服场景中，该方法优于强基线，在严格延迟约束下保持高准确率；在Llama 3.1 8B模型上，仅使用第16层激活即可保持准确率同时降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信赖的RAG部署提供了一条可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

TL;DR: 本文通过受控评估框架系统追踪符号接地在语言模型内部计算中的出现机制，发现接地主要集中在中层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境基础来支持语言形式预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大规模训练的语言模型中符号接地现象的具体位置和驱动机制，这一问题目前尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制性和因果分析系统追踪符号接地在内部计算中的出现过程。

Result: 接地现象集中在模型的中层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境基础实现；该现象在多模态对话和不同架构（Transformers和状态空间模型）中可复现，但在单向LSTMs中未出现。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据表明符号接地可以在语言模型中自然涌现，对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过训练模型定期压缩KV缓存的方法，使用特殊标记压缩历史生成内容，以解决长上下文推理中KV缓存线性增长带来的内存和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer KV缓存线性增长的严重限制，这会带来显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理标记，过去生成标记的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 提出定期使用学习的特殊目的标记压缩生成KV缓存，并驱逐压缩条目。通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型执行这种压缩，利用RL输出进行蒸馏以最小化训练开销。

Result: 经验证明，该方法在内存-准确率帕累托边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练压缩技术。

Conclusion: 通过训练模型定期压缩KV缓存的方法能够有效解决长上下文推理中的内存和计算成本问题，在内存效率和准确性之间达到更好的平衡。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一个轻量级的通用压缩器，能够从检索文档中提取相关信息并生成简洁摘要，用于增强检索增强生成(RAG)系统，特别针对复杂多跳问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务时上下文不断扩展，虽然提供了更丰富的信息，但也带来了更高的延迟和模型认知负担。特别是对于复杂的多跳问题，需要解决这种瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用相对较短的上下文（少于1k词）作为种子数据，训练BRIEF-Pro对超过10k词的长上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户灵活控制摘要长度（指定句子数量）。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，BRIEF-Pro能生成更简洁相关的摘要，提升小型、大型和专有语言模型的性能。使用70B阅读器模型时，32倍压缩比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩性能平均提升4.67%，而计算开销仅需其23%。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro是一种有效的上下文压缩方法，能够在保持问答性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为处理长上下文RAG任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

*Aditya Ganeshan,Kurt Fleischer,Wenzel Jakob,Ariel Shamir,Daniel Ritchie,Takeo Igarashi,Maria Larsson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG)的语言来建模CNC铣削几何，并通过共优化零件几何来恢复传统木工接头的紧密配合，解决了CNC铣削导致的几何偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统木工接头虽然坚固耐用，但由于手工制作成本高且困难，在现代工作流程中很少使用。CNC铣削提供了可扩展的替代方案，但直接铣削传统接头往往因几何偏差（如圆角）而无法产生功能性结果。

Method: 1) 设计MXG语言来表示可铣削几何，将每个铣削操作建模为具有工具方向和钻头半径的减法挤出体积；2) 通过表面邻近度和铣削路径约束来形式化紧密耦合，并推导出两个可微分的损失函数来优化接头几何。

Result: 在30个传统接头设计上评估该方法，证明其能产生CNC兼容、紧密配合的接头，近似原始几何形状。

Conclusion: 通过重新解释传统接头以适应CNC工作流程，延续了这一传统工艺的演变，并确保其在未来制造实践中的相关性。

Abstract: Traditional integral wood joints, despite their strength, durability, and
elegance, remain rare in modern workflows due to the cost and difficulty of
manual fabrication. CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly
milling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because
milling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter
the target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting
surfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or
block assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language
that represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to
restore coupling. We introduce Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG), a language
for representing geometry as the outcome of milling operations performed with
flat-end drill bits. MXG represents each operation as a subtractive extrusion
volume defined by a tool direction and drill radius. This parameterization
enables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius
drill bit, matching traditional joint designs. Increasing the radius then
reveals milling-induced deviations, which compromise the integrity of the
joint. To restore coupling, we formalize tight coupling in terms of both
surface proximity and proximity constraints on the mill-bit paths associated
with mating surfaces. We then derive two tractable, differentiable losses that
enable efficient optimization of joint geometry. We evaluate our method on 30
traditional joint designs, demonstrating that it produces CNC-compatible,
tightly fitting joints that approximates the original geometry. By
reinterpreting traditional joints for CNC workflows, we continue the evolution
of this heritage craft and help ensure its relevance in future making
practices.

Motivation: 使用智能手机单目捕捉替代昂贵的多相机系统，使非专业用户也能进行虚拟形象数字化。

Method: 结合静态姿势序列和动态运动序列数据，采用轻量级表达方式，从网格中提取服装变形并附加光照感知高斯模型。

Result: 在移动设备上达到120FPS，独立VR设备上90FPS的2K分辨率渲染，比现有移动引擎基准快2.7倍以上。

Conclusion: HRM²Avatar在视觉真实性和实时交互性方面优于现有最先进的单目方法。

Abstract: We present HRM$^2$Avatar, a framework for creating high-fidelity avatars from
monocular phone scans, which can be rendered and animated in real time on
mobile devices. Monocular capture with smartphones provides a low-cost
alternative to studio-grade multi-camera rigs, making avatar digitization
accessible to non-expert users. Reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from
single-view video sequences poses challenges due to limited visual and
geometric data. To address these limitations, at the data level, our method
leverages two types of data captured with smartphones: static pose sequences
for texture reconstruction and dynamic motion sequences for learning
pose-dependent deformations and lighting changes. At the representation level,
we employ a lightweight yet expressive representation to reconstruct
high-fidelity digital humans from sparse monocular data. We extract garment
meshes from monocular data to model clothing deformations effectively, and
attach illumination-aware Gaussians to the mesh surface, enabling high-fidelity
rendering and capturing pose-dependent lighting. This representation
efficiently learns high-resolution and dynamic information from monocular data,
enabling the creation of detailed avatars. At the rendering level, real-time
performance is critical for animating high-fidelity avatars in AR/VR, social
gaming, and on-device creation. Our GPU-driven rendering pipeline delivers 120
FPS on mobile devices and 90 FPS on standalone VR devices at 2K resolution,
over $2.7\times$ faster than representative mobile-engine baselines.
Experiments show that HRM$^2$Avatar delivers superior visual realism and
real-time interactivity, outperforming state-of-the-art monocular methods.

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式解决LLMs规则僵化问题，显著提升人类对齐表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为智能体推理引擎存在规则僵化问题，过度遵循显式规则导致决策与人类常识和意图不一致，而监督微调方法计算成本高且不易获取。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式让模型解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并证明最终决策，是一种低计算成本的元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要细微判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)，并产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、易获取且有效的方法，引导LLMs从字面指令遵循转向自由、目标导向的推理，为构建更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过熵基优势函数和选择性样本加权来增强深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现，在标准强化学习下，规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，表明存在未充分优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的项来塑造令牌级优势函数，为高熵令牌分配更大的更新；2）选择性加权规划密集型样本的优势函数。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低训练预算的情况下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效增强了语言模型的规划能力，为复杂任务的长期规划提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化时序逻辑的LLM具身智能体物理安全评估框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行多级验证，相比启发式方法能更精确地发现安全违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观的LLM判断来评估具身智能体的安全性，缺乏形式化基础，无法精确指定状态不变量、时序依赖和时间约束等物理安全要求。

Method: 使用时序逻辑形式化自然语言安全需求，构建多级验证流水线：语义层验证LLM对安全需求的理解，规划层验证高层动作计划，轨迹层合并执行轨迹进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身智能体，发现之前方法忽略的安全违规，并揭示其失效模式。

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时序逻辑并在多个层次应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

Motivation: 两车事故占道路事故的70%，但现有DHA数据因人工编码不一致且劳动密集而可靠性有限，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车事故数据，在详细事故叙述上微调Llama 3.2 1B模型，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统机器学习分类器进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模自动化DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预提供了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为基于大型语言模型的推理任务，强调因果结构和可解释性，而非传统的数值回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分析在真实世界环境中存在局限性，无法有效应对政策变化、人类行为适应和突发事件。LLMs提供了整合多模态输入的新机会，但现有方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，优先考虑因果结构和可解释性，利用LLMs的深层推理能力而非数值回归能力。

Result: 该方法使时间序列分析更接近人类对齐的理解，能够在复杂真实世界环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考LLMs在时间序列分析中的使用方式，将其作为推理工具而非回归工具，以实现更有效的因果分析和解释性洞察。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出PBRR框架，通过从人类偏好中学习过渡依赖的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与真实目标不匹配，导致策略错位；而完全从零学习奖励函数成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架使用目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，学习一个加性的、过渡依赖的修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格域中PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好RL方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于基线方法，学习高性能策略所需偏好数量显著减少。

Conclusion: PBRR能有效修复错配的奖励函数，以更少的人类偏好实现高性能策略学习，结合了代理奖励和偏好学习的优势。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Conclusion: 该情感认知框架成功实现了LLM智能体与人类的情感对齐，为构建更真实的社会模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 虽然链式思维提示和深度推理能提升复杂任务性能，但将其应用于所有问题计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，仅在必要时才进行深度推理，实现计算资源的优化分配。

Result: 对于简单问题，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略，同时在复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统在保持性能的同时有效降低了计算成本，为LLM的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an
LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model
and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into
computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's

TL;DR: 提出了Jericho测试时学习基准(J-TTL)来衡量AI代理在测试时学习复杂技能的能力，并开发了EvoTest进化测试时学习框架，通过进化整个代理系统来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理无法在测试时动态学习复杂技能，在陌生环境中表现不佳，这严重限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: EvoTest框架包含两个角色：执行游戏的Actor代理和分析游戏记录以提出改进配置的Evolver代理，通过进化整个代理系统而不需要微调或梯度更新。

Result: 在J-TTL基准测试中，EvoTest持续提升性能，优于反思、仅记忆和在线微调等方法，是唯一能够赢得两个游戏的方法。

Conclusion: EvoTest通过进化方法有效解决了AI代理测试时学习的挑战，为开发更实用的AI代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了状态-动作联合攻击(SAJA)框架，通过协同利用状态和动作扰动来攻击多智能体深度强化学习模型，相比单独的状态或动作攻击更有效且隐蔽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究只关注状态攻击或动作攻击，没有考虑如何有效联合两者。简单随机组合状态和动作扰动无法发挥它们的协同效应。

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：(1)状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升方法，结合actor和critic网络计算对抗状态；(2)动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态，使用critic网络计算最终对抗动作，并添加启发式正则化器增强critic指导效果。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle Environment中的评估表明，SAJA优于单独的状态或动作攻击，更具隐蔽性，且现有防御方法无法抵御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架通过协同利用状态和动作扰动，有效提升了多智能体深度强化学习模型的攻击效果，揭示了现有防御方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Result: 在9个真实数据集和2个合成设置上验证，PORAT相比现有最优方法性能提升达8.1%

Conclusion: PORAT通过博弈论方法有效解决了理性化中的模式崩溃问题，为构建自解释模型提供了新思路

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的置信度作为奖励信号，无需训练即可在数学推理任务中超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于大多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而无训练方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽然有效但未充分研究置信度作为奖励的潜力。

Method: 使用token级置信度作为奖励代理，特别适合闭端任务；提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度分数和正确性信号构建偏好数据进行微调。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew优于现有无训练奖励方法，与模型推理性能强相关，能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: CRew是简单有效的无训练奖励方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型判断能力，优于现有自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for

Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其行为和推理可能超出较弱代理和人类的理解范围，影响可解释性和监督。需要开发方法使模型产生对较弱协作伙伴可理解的解决方案。

Method: 引入串联训练，一种强化学习范式，在训练过程中随机从冻结的弱模型而非强模型中采样token。只有当强模型的行为和推理过程能够被弱模型继续时，才能成功完成rollout。

Conclusion: 串联训练为构建可由较弱代理审计的AI系统提供了有前景的途径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大化人类赋能的辅助语言模型调优方法Empower，该方法仅需离线文本数据，无需额外人工反馈即可训练出更好的辅助AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前辅助代理往往倾向于独立完成任务而非真正协助人类达成目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。需要一种更有效的自监督方法来训练真正协助人类的AI。

Method: 基于最大化人类赋能（影响环境的能力）的Empower方法，仅使用离线文本数据进行自监督微调语言模型。

Result: 用户研究中78%的参与者偏好Empower助手，接受率提高31%，建议减少38%。在编程环境中，Empower将模拟程序员的成功率平均提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个仅使用离线数据即可训练有用对齐AI的框架，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于控制理论的安全护栏方法，用于预防AI代理在交互过程中可能造成的下游危害，如财务损失或物理伤害，而不是简单地阻止有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全护栏主要依赖输出分类和人工指定标准，无法应对新的危险情况，且检测到不安全时通常只是拒绝行动，这并不总是安全的选择。

Method: 将AI安全建模为序列决策问题，在AI模型的世界表示中应用安全关键控制理论，构建预测性护栏来实时监控和主动修正风险输出。

Result: 在模拟驾驶和电子商务场景中的实验表明，控制理论护栏能可靠地引导LLM代理避免灾难性后果，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前标记-阻止式护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更有效地确保AI代理的安全性。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Method: 构建了Hard2Verify基准，包含500多小时人工标注，评估29个生成式批评器和过程奖励模型在步骤级验证任务中的表现。

Result: 除了少数表现优异者外，开源验证器普遍落后于闭源模型。研究还分析了步骤级验证性能差的原因、验证器计算规模的影响以及自验证和验证-生成动态等基本问题。

Conclusion: Hard2Verify基准揭示了当前验证器在步骤级数学证明验证中的局限性，为改进LLM推理系统的验证能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
