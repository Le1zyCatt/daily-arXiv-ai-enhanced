### [1] [Capture, Canonicalize, Splat: Zero-Shot 3D Gaussian Avatars from Unstructured Phone Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14081)
*Emanuel Garbin,Guy Adam,Oded Krams,Zohar Barzelay,Eran Guendelman,Michael Schwarz,Moran Vatelmacher,Yigal Shenkman,Eli Peker,Itai Druker,Uri Patish,Yoav Blum,Max Bluvstein,Junxuan Li,Rawal Khirodkar,Shunsuke Saito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量非结构化手机图像创建超逼真、身份保持的3D头像的零样本方法，通过生成规范化和基于transformer的模型解决现有方法的几何不一致和细节缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在单视角几何不一致和幻觉问题，降低身份保持；基于合成数据训练的模型无法捕捉皮肤皱纹和细发等高频细节，限制真实感。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1) 生成规范化模块处理多个非结构化视图为标准一致表示；(2) 基于transformer的模型，在从真实人物圆顶捕捉生成的高斯溅射头像大规模数据集上训练。采用"捕捉、规范化、溅射"流程。

Result: 从非结构化照片生成具有引人注目的真实感和鲁棒身份保持的静态四分之三身体头像。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成规范化和高质量数据集训练，成功解决了3D头像创建中的几何一致性和细节真实性问题。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

### [2] [GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270)
*Alexander Valverde,Brian Xu,Yuyin Zhou,Meng Xu,Hongyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GauSSmart是一种混合方法，将2D基础模型与3D高斯溅射重建相结合，通过2D分割先验和特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化，提升稀疏区域的覆盖度和细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉精细细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 集成2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，通过将2D基础模型与3D重建管道有机结合，可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

### [3] [Inpainting the Red Planet: Diffusion Models for the Reconstruction of Martian Environments in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14765)
*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，填补卫星高度图中的缺失值，相比传统方法在重建精度和感知相似性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据中存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星，需要开发专门的无条件深度学习方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个来自NASA HiRISE调查的火星高度图增强数据集上进行训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，固定分辨率为128x128。

Result: 在1000个样本的评估集上，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似性（LPIPS提升29-81%）方面均优于逆距离加权、克里金插值和纳维-斯托克斯算法等传统方法。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，填补高度图中的缺失值，为太空探索中的虚拟现实应用提供更可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

### [4] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiFoodChat框架，这是一个基于对话的多智能体推理系统，用于零样本食物识别，无需额外训练或标注即可实现高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，需要开发无需标注就能识别新食物类别的零样本方法。

Method: 集成视觉语言模型和大语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理，使用对象感知令牌捕获细粒度视觉特征，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，实现了无需训练的人类化复杂食物场景理解。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [5] [Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976)
*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，使用两个条件扩散模型分别处理时间先验和空间先验，支持图像驱动交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态上下文信息，人类可以基于行为先验直观推断上下文并预测可能的过去和未来动态。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：(1)姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；(2)姿态生成器应用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实证实验证明了姿态先验的普适性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动作捕捉数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景，支持多样化的交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症中深色子宫内膜植入物的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注检测区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多样的视觉表现且位置多变，使得识别困难且容易出错，特别是对于非专科医生。该系统旨在为妇科医生提供辅助诊断。

Method: 训练了一个系统来分析腹腔镜手术视频，识别深色子宫内膜植入物区域，并用多色覆盖层进行标注，同时提供检测摘要以便视频浏览。

Result: 系统能够成功识别和分割深色子宫内膜植入物，并在视频中实时标注检测区域，提供检测总结。

Conclusion: 该系统为子宫内膜异位症的诊断提供了有效的计算机辅助工具，有助于提高诊断准确性和视频浏览效率。

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [7] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究结合传统视觉模型和视觉语言模型，在遥感图像分析中实现了更准确和上下文感知的图像解释，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解方面取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据量大但传统视觉模型受限于需要大量标注数据和理解复杂环境的能力有限，视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将YOLO目标检测模型与LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini等视觉语言模型结合，在标记和未标记遥感数据以及退化图像场景中进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数方面平均MAE改进48.46%，在挑战性条件下表现优异；CLIPScore改进6.17%用于遥感图像综合理解。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进和高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于AI的系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该模型在内部和外部验证中表现出色，并且在专家间一致性分析中超越了9位病理学家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的组织学特征，但存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题，需要提高检测准确性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个前列腺核心针活检切片上进行训练，并在多个队列中进行内部和外部验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55；在专家间一致性分析中表现最佳（kappa=0.66）。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [9] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，扩展对抗净化方法以处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动效果不佳，而现实中非加性扰动很常见。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能有效处理非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [10] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图的检索-推理增强生成框架，通过结构化图表示视频片段间的语义关系，并引入中间推理步骤来提升长视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频语言模型在处理超出上下文窗口的密集视频标记和保留长期序列信息方面的困难，以及传统RAG方法在长视频中面临的时间依赖关系破坏和无关信息包含的问题。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：(1) 使用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系；(2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，促进跨片段相关信息的显式聚合。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，比最先进的视频RAG方法高出8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理步骤，有效提升了长视频语言模型的理解能力，在多个基准测试中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一个基于原型学习的视频同步框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来对齐不同场景或生成AI视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同场景或生成AI视频之间的复杂同步挑战，这些视频存在多样化主体、背景和非线性时间错位问题。

Method: 使用预训练模型提取高维嵌入，学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段，构建共享的紧凑1D表示。

Result: 在多样化数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在视频同步领域具有重要创新价值。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

*Alexandr A. Kalinin,Anne E. Carpenter,Shantanu Singh,Matthew J. O'Meara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决生物图像分析中的可扩展性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集需要更高效的计算方法，现有工具缺乏API支持、GPU加速、3D处理能力和工作流互操作性。

Method: 基于CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM，提供设备无关的API，自动在GPU和CPU之间调度操作，加速图像处理流程。

Result: 在单个操作和现有去卷积、分割流程的基准测试中实现了显著加速，同时保持算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重复的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

*Hongsong Wang,Renxi Cheng,Yang Zhang,Chaolei Han,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位平面处理的轻量级AI生成图像检测方法，通过噪声特征提取和最大梯度补丁选择，在GenImage基准上达到98.9%的平均准确率，比现有方法快近百倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建误差的AI生成图像检测方法计算成本高且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征，需要更高效准确的检测方案。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理提取噪声特征，设计最大梯度补丁选择机制来放大噪声信号，并构建轻量级分类头（噪声分类器和噪声引导分类器）。

Result: 在GenImage基准上平均准确率达98.9%（提升11.9%），跨生成器泛化能力强（GAN到Diffusion 98.2%，Diffusion到GAN 99.2%），提取速度达到毫秒级。

Conclusion: 该方法通过位平面噪声特征提取和高效分类设计，实现了高精度、高效率的AI生成图像检测，具有优秀的跨生成器泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIA的多模态音频-视觉框架，通过整合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来检测深度伪造视频，解决了传统检测方法在识别先进生成模型产生的深度伪造时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视素对齐阈值、基础帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染技术等先进生成模型产生的现代深度伪造，这些技术生成的帧近乎完美但会产生容易被传统检测器忽略的微小时间差异。

Method: 开发了PIA多模态音频-视觉框架，整合了音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来识别跨多个互补模态的不一致性。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，能够识别传统检测器容易忽略的时间差异和跨模态不一致性。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析方法有效解决了现代深度伪造检测的挑战，为对抗日益复杂的生成模型提供了更强大的检测工具。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有的基于事件的OCC系统虽然使用了事件视觉传感器，但未能充分利用其独特特性，需要专门设计的调制方案。

Method: 提出事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调整EVS参数并定制化以优化EIM的频率响应，实验确定EIM的最大调制阶数，并基于获得的参数进行传输实验。

Result: 成功在室内环境中实现28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的传输，为基于事件的OCC系统设定了新的比特率基准。

Conclusion: EIM方案能够有效利用事件视觉传感器的独特特性，显著提升基于事件的OCC系统的传输性能，证明了该方法的可行性和优越性。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，传统SCR方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单个网络的容量

Method: 引入混合专家网络和门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略(ALF-LB)提高定位精度

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，在保持更高精度的同时显著降低成本

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，实现了计算成本与精度的良好平衡

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

TL;DR: 提出IPRO方法，通过强化学习优化视频扩散模型，解决图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性问题，特别是在人脸占比小的场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当视频中人脸表情变化大、运动剧烈或人脸在图像中占比小时，人类对身份变化高度敏感，这成为关键挑战。

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化(IPRO)框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号加速收敛，提出将真实视频中的人脸作为特征池的多角度面部评分机制，并加入KL散度正则化防止过拟合。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份保持能力，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在动态交互场景中难以保持多个人类角色的身份一致性，这在多角色视频生成中至关重要。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，然后使用针对多人类一致性定制的GRPO变体进行策略优化。

Result: Identity-GRPO在人类一致性指标上比基线方法提升了18.9%，并通过消融研究评估了标注质量和设计选择对策略优化的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行的见解，显著改善了多人类身份保持的视频生成质量。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder，通过动态匹配相对位置和分层处理，实现高效高精度的跨视角匹配，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像的跨视角匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制难以有效处理。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样；设计分层跨视角解码器MatchDecoder；引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失来处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB显存即可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像；在KITTI 2012/2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 结合高精度和低计算复杂度，实现了实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视角匹配。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能有效生成高质量合成眼部图像，为解决虹膜生物识别数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Motivation: 主流多模态大语言模型仅通过文本token的下一个token预测进行监督，忽略了视觉中心的关键信息，这限制了模型的视觉分析能力。

Method: 引入可学习的模块化任务查询(MTQs)和视觉对齐层(VALs)，在多个视觉基础模型的监督下激活特定视觉信号，并通过Token Gateway Mask(TGM)协调不同视觉基础模型之间的表示冲突。

Result: 大量实验表明，VaCo显著提升了不同MLLMs在各种基准测试上的性能，展示了其在视觉理解方面的卓越能力。

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制，有效统一了文本和视觉输出的优化，显著增强了多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

### [29] [DOS: Directional Object Separation in Text Embeddings for Multi-Object Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14376)
*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS方法通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来解决多对象图像生成中的对象忽略和混合问题，在四个基准测试中显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象忽略或对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象四种场景下。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入输入文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS在四个基准测试中比其他四种竞争方法多获得26.24%-43.04%的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改进多对象图像生成的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构和空间填充曲线技术，在脑肿瘤分割任务中实现高效的长距离依赖建模，同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中计算开销大、多轴特征扫描效率低的问题，并填补BraTS数据分区鲁棒性评估的空白。

Method: 使用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射保持空间局部性，提出门控融合模块自适应整合前后向上下文，采用量化块离散化特征提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%，计算效率提升15倍。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升计算效率，展现了在脑肿瘤分割任务中的鲁棒性和计算优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个可复现的主板组装级缺陷检测框架，通过YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN基准测试，提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精度和召回率，并评估了实际扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主板组装级缺陷检测在电子制造中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，组装级检测研究不足。

Method: 在MiracleFactory数据集上基准测试YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN，提出置信度-时间投票(CTV Voter)集成方法，评估锐度、亮度和方向变化等实际扰动。

Result: YOLOv7精度高但召回率低，Faster R-CNN召回率高但精度低，CTV Voter成功平衡了精度和召回率，并开发了可部署的GUI检测工具。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉技术可以从基准结果过渡到主板组装制造的实际质量保证应用。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCMIL的双课程对比多实例学习模型，用于从全切片图像中学习癌症预后表示，无需密集标注，在12种癌症类型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临全切片图像计算量大和标注稀缺的挑战，现有方法常忽略多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习策略，通过双课程对比多实例学习处理全切片图像，直接将其转换为预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万个图块）上的实验表明，DCMIL优于标准WSI预后模型，并能识别细粒度预后相关区域。

Conclusion: DCMIL提供了一种有效的癌症预后分析方法，能够识别预后相关区域、提供不确定性估计，并揭示正常与肿瘤组织的形态差异。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的神经视频压缩框架，结合了帧内和帧间编码，通过自适应单模型处理每帧，并采用双向两帧压缩设计，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容时效率低下，存在帧间误差传播和累积问题，需要借鉴传统视频编码中的帧内编码思想来解决这些限制。

Method: 构建统一的帧内/帧间编码框架，使用单一模型自适应处理每帧；提出同时两帧压缩设计，充分利用前后向帧间冗余；无需手动刷新机制即可拦截误差传播。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的帧级码率和质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该方案成功解决了神经视频压缩中的关键限制，通过统一编码框架和双向压缩设计实现了显著的性能提升和稳定性改进。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但基于深度学习的检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 该方法在攻击效果上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe方法，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 提出的攻击方法在视频目标检测中实现了更有效的通用对抗攻击，同时保证了扰动的隐蔽性。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Conclusion: 生成模型为异常检测提供了有前景的方向，支持半监督学习、新成像生物标志物发现以及跨疾病偏差映射。未来工作应关注解剖感知建模、基础模型开发、适当评估指标和严格临床验证。

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩多任务图像恢复模型的策略，通过迭代剪枝方法在过参数化深度模型中寻找高度稀疏的子网络，在仅保留10%可训练参数的情况下保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但通常参数量过大导致计算效率低下，需要开发压缩方法。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重并将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现能保持高性能的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务的基准数据集上，MIR-L模型仅保留10%的可训练参数，同时保持了高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代剪枝方法能够有效压缩多任务图像恢复模型，在极高稀疏度下发现性能匹配甚至超越密集模型的子网络。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Sentinel-2卫星时间序列数据，通过CNN-LSTM集成模型检测牧场放牧活动，F1分数达77%，在有限检查资源下能显著提高非放牧场地的识别效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性都有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法，需要开发基于卫星数据的自动化检测技术

Method: 利用Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据（4-10月），为每个多边形定义的地块边界训练CNN-LSTM集成模型，进行二元预测（放牧/未放牧）

Result: 模型在五个验证分割上平均F1分数为77%，对放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。在仅能检查4%地块的情况下，优先检查模型预测的非放牧地块，比随机检查多发现17.2倍的非放牧场地

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据可以可靠地指导检查资源分配，用于保护导向的土地利用合规监测

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分类中表现出优于Vision Transformers的潜力，其网络规模随输入图像分辨率线性增长，而ViT是二次增长，这提高了计算和内存效率。此外，Vision Mamba比传统CNN需要更少的可训练参数。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为主干网络构建神经网络，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率。与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，并进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT。源代码已公开以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出一种噪声投影器，通过文本条件优化将初始噪声映射到与提示更匹配的分布，改善Stable Diffusion生成图像与文本的对齐度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声来自提示特定子空间，而推理时来自提示无关的高斯先验，导致图像与提示对齐不佳

Method: 设计噪声投影器，基于提示嵌入将噪声映射到提示感知的对应物；通过采样噪声、从视觉语言模型获取反馈、蒸馏到奖励模型，最后通过准直接偏好优化优化投影器

Result: 实验表明提示感知噪声投影显著提高了各种提示下的文本-图像对齐度

Conclusion: 该方法无需参考图像或手工先验，推理成本低，通过单次前向传播替代多样本选择，有效改善文本-图像对齐

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Result: DentVFM展现出强大的泛化智能，在疾病诊断、治疗分析、生物标志物识别和解剖标志检测分割等任务中表现优异，在跨模态诊断中甚至优于经验丰富的牙医。

Conclusion: DentVFM为牙科AI设立了新范式，提供了可扩展、适应性强且标签效率高的模型，有助于改善智能牙科医疗并填补全球口腔医疗的关键空白。

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一个用于脑部MRI图像域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过解耦域不变和域特定特征，在保持疾病相关信息的同时提高模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MRI）存在跨成像站点的域偏移问题，这会降低机器学习在疾病分类等任务中的性能。现有域协调方法虽然效果好但缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出PL-SE-ADA框架，包含两个编码器分别提取域不变特征和域特定特征，一个解码器用于图像重建，以及一个域预测器。通过对抗训练和从两个特征分量重建图像来确保协调性和信息保留。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别方面达到同等或更好的性能，同时能够可视化域独立脑部特征和域特定成分。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA不仅实现了有效的域协调，还提供了整个框架的高可解释性，在医疗应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Method: 将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个作为视觉知识的独立但互补组件，通过重建驱动的预训练方案学习捕捉每个视觉描述符的本质。

Result: 通过显式分解视觉属性，该方法在图像生成和编辑等高级视觉任务中促进有效的属性控制，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法对视觉理解具有有效性，展示了经典视觉描述符在现代深度学习中的价值。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法都是一步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集不够充分，需要多步调整能力来实现更精确的对齐。

Method: 提出模型无关的多步调整方法FMA，通过学习跨模态速度场实现特征对齐。包括固定耦合策略确保类别对应、噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺、早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上，FMA都能带来显著的性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，相比一步PEFT方法具有明显优势。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的身份偏移问题，特别是当模型不知道所有目标场景时，传统方法依赖不现实的先验知识假设。

Method: 提出SDeC方法，通过识别和抑制ID提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性，使用SVD方向稳定性量化来自适应重新加权相应特征值。

Result: 实验证明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC是一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，其中先验知识通常不可用或随时间变化。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键效率问题：高斯密度分配不均、计算负载不平衡和内存访问碎片化，限制了训练效率。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式负载敏感高斯密度控制，平衡点分布；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并，动态分配工作负载；3) 映射层面：重排序内存访问策略，优化RGB存储和批量加载。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上相比3DGS实现1.44倍训练加速，质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Result: 在LlamaPointInPart数据集上表现出优于基线模型的性能，实现了像素级的关键点定位。

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新的应用前景。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持连贯物体运动和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单头优化中纹理优先于时间一致性的问题。

Method: 提出两个核心组件：1）实例线索 - 将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；2）密集RoPE - 在token空间中保持这些线索的显著性，结合RGB+辅助图预测来稳定优化。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，改善了时间连贯性，无需复杂的逐帧轨迹脚本。

Conclusion: STANCE框架通过简单的组件有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，在保持易用性的同时显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，有效提升了KB-VQA任务中多模态知识检索和答案生成的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 羽毛球战术理解不仅需要解释单个动作，还需要理解战术如何随时间动态执行。现有方法缺乏对战术执行过程的描述能力。

Method: 采用双分支设计，包括视觉编码器、时空Transformer编码器和基于Transformer的解码器。引入战术单元检测器识别有效战术单元、类型和状态，并通过击球级提示引导机制将战术类型和状态嵌入到解码器中。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成击球和战术字幕方面有效。消融研究显示基于ResNet50的时空编码器优于其他变体，击球级提示结构能产生更连贯准确的战术字幕。

Conclusion: Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成羽毛球视频的多尺度字幕，既能描述单个动作，也能捕捉战术执行过程，包括被中断后恢复的战术执行。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的token冗余，从而降低处理成本并提高推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理密集帧序列时面临二次计算成本的问题，长视频经常超出语言模型的token预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: EVS通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁来减少token冗余，保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS显著减少了token数量，同时保持语义保真度，使大型语言模型的首次token时间减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: EVS持续改善了效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现了可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器的单个连续潜在令牌表示图像，通过微调语义令牌嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时利用自监督学习的优势构建紧凑有效的潜在空间。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，微调语义令牌嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失保持潜在空间几何特性。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上实现零样本文本到图像合成，训练成本极低。

Conclusion: 微调的SSL表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，为高效生成建模提供潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Motivation: 解决基于梯度的扩散TTA方法在探索性和泛化性方面的局限性，特别是在处理不同类型失真时的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导方法，通过伪标签驱动的奖励机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索与置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于基线方法，且无需任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA框架有效提升了测试时适应性能，通过引导扩散过程实现了更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，通过上下文学习从未配对视频剪辑中学习视频编辑能力，显著减少了对大规模配对视频编辑数据集的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的视频编辑由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本和复杂性而进展缓慢，需要一种更高效的训练方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在约100万个真实视频剪辑上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万个精选编辑对上进行微调以扩展编辑任务并提高编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有方法，编辑指令遵循度提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该预训练策略能够有效赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，并通过少量高质量配对数据进一步优化，为指令式视频编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下表现优异，但计算成本高昂，难以在资源受限的工业环境中应用

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性集成DBP方法，迭代减少各层的输入相关性以加速收敛

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中同时减少训练时间、能源消耗并提升下游任务性能，适用于实际工业场景

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度或地理范围上有限，需要一致的长期监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个任务：(1)多时相采矿足迹制图，使用新的变化感知时序IoU指标评估；(2)跨时相变化检测。基准测试了20个最先进的深度学习模型。

Result: GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致和可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及应用GeoAI实现社会和环境的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖强教师模型或大数据集，在现实世界有限数据场景中效果受限，存在知识退化、监督效率低等问题。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还进行知识精炼后传递。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上超越现有监督方法，在其他两个医学影像数据集上验证了泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在有限数据上获得最高+23%的累积准确率提升。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识传递显著提升了特征学习能力，降低了数据依赖性，在有限数据场景下具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Result: 在Qwen2VL-7B和GPT4o基准上，视频时间定位和推理问答任务均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，有效提升了视频理解能力。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用学习先验提升3DGS压缩性能，实现了更紧凑表示和增强的渲染质量，具有良好的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来基于卫星的机器辅助海洋哺乳动物监测提供了可扩展的第一步，且不依赖标记训练数据。

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义，CFSAM能加速收敛且不引入显著计算开销

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Motivation: 现实世界中的图像标注通常具有不同粒度，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求影响，而现有方法假设完整的细粒度标注，这在实际中很少满足。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提升了分层分类性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准测试和相关方法推动了在现实约束下的分层分类研究进展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Method: 通过优化文本提示合成类别条件图像，这些合成样本用于生成详细的自然语言报告，描述类别特定的决策模式和偏见，无需训练数据或真实标签。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类别级别偏见报告方面优于现有方法，定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示其产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER是一个灵活且有效的框架，能够揭示视觉分类器的内部机制，在激活最大化、切片发现和去偏见以及偏见解释等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

*Xu Wu,Zhihui Lai,Xianxu Hou,Jie Zhou,Ya-nan Zhang,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LightQANet框架，通过量化特征学习和自适应提示模块解决低光图像增强中的纹理恢复、颜色一致性和伪影问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法由于像素级信息严重退化，难以提取可靠的特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题。

Method: 提出LightQANet框架：1）静态建模：设计光量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因子；2）动态适应：引入光感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示，动态指导特征学习。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下均实现最先进的性能，提供优越的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化特征学习和自适应提示机制，能够有效提升低光图像增强的鲁棒性和一致性，在不同光照条件下保持高质量的图像恢复。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Motivation: 传统无线电通信在微型飞行器群中存在频谱拥堵、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找更可靠的替代通信方式。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为微型飞行器群提供了一种节能高效的通信替代方案，特别适用于受限环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL通过引入视觉链式思维推理框架，将目标检测分解为区域感知、类别识别和背景分离三个步骤，结合对比背景学习，在拥挤和遮挡场景中显著提升了开放词汇目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出CoT-PL框架，采用结构化的视觉链式思维推理，将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景分离，并结合对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别的伪标签质量相比最佳先前方法分别提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO数据集上AP50提升了7.7，在LVIS数据集上新类别的mask AP提升了2.9，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过引入链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能，为处理语义复杂场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，超越现有方法15-23%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算病理学基础模型往往忽视器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物学过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个独特形态内的连续变异谱，反映恶性转化是通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原理。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），比现有结直肠癌特异性方法高15%准确率，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的稳健性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM模型成功捕捉了结直肠癌的形态多样性，提供了优越的预后预测性能，证明了整合连续形态变异谱在计算病理学中的价值。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的新方法，大幅减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的需求，在多种肿瘤类型上实现了与基于掩模训练相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测能挽救生命，但CT扫描中的小肿瘤检测困难。传统AI训练需要大量人工绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中每份CT扫描都配有描述肿瘤特征的医学报告，这些丰富信息未被充分利用。

Method: 提出R-Super方法，训练AI根据医学报告中的肿瘤描述来分割肿瘤。该方法利用大量现成的医学报告进行AI训练，显著减少对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的依赖。

Result: 使用101,654份报告训练的AI模型性能与使用723个掩模训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩模训练时，灵敏度提高+13%，特异性提高+8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种的检测表现超过放射科医生。首次实现了脾脏、胆囊、前列腺、膀胱、子宫和食管肿瘤的分割。

Conclusion: 这项研究挑战了大规模人工绘制肿瘤掩模不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了一条可扩展且易于实现的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新颖的轨迹表示学习框架，通过统一环境感知和显式路径选择建模来改进轨迹编码，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了影响轨迹形成的外部环境和内部路径选择行为，这限制了表示质量。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块（从POI分布捕获多粒度环境语义）和路径选择编码器（将路段转换建模为决策序列），最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过结合环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的效果，具有强大的数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决大模型在智能手机上部署时面临的内存和计算限制问题，同时保持模型生成质量。

Method: 分数位量化方法，渐进式降低模型精度，在优化过程中利用分数位。

Result: 在SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart和FLUX.1-schnell等扩散模型上提高了质量，FiD比标准QAT低4-7%，并在三星S25U手机上成功部署运行。

Conclusion: 分数位量化方法有效解决了模型量化后的质量保持问题，实现了在移动设备上的高效部署。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

Motivation: 解决肿瘤分割AI训练中缺乏大规模体素级标注数据集的问题，发现真实数据存在性能瓶颈，而合成数据可以更高效地提升模型性能。

Method: 创建了包含10,135个CT扫描的AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，由23名放射科专家在六个器官（胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管、子宫）中进行体素级肿瘤标注，并包含5,893个对照扫描。

Result: 与现有公共数据集相比，在分布内测试中DSC提升+7%，在分布外测试中DSC提升+16%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练肿瘤分割AI提供了强大的基础，证明大规模高质量标注数据集可以显著提升模型性能，特别是通过合成数据可以更高效地训练模型。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在现实场景表现出色，但在想象力场景中性能显著下降，因为这些提示涉及罕见共现概念和长距离语义关系，超出了训练分布范围。

Method: ImagerySearch是一种提示引导的自适应测试时搜索策略，根据提示中的语义关系动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数。

Conclusion: ImagerySearch方法在挑战性想象力设置中能够生成更连贯和视觉上合理的视频，证明了其在不同提示类型上的有效性。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了多模态大语言模型在面部识别任务上的表现，发现虽然MLLMs能捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中仍落后于专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准上与现有面部识别模型进行对比评估。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs能够捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用面部识别模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别研究奠定了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI生成方法，通过细粒度意图控制生成多样化、物理合理的手-物体交互，超越了传统固定抓握模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，基于物理先验或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常HOI的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集，提出TOUCH三阶段框架，使用多级扩散模型实现细粒度语义控制，通过显式接触建模和物理约束确保真实性。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互，代表日常活动中的各种交互模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互的生成能力，为手-物体交互研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分对自车有威胁的事故和与自车无关的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络端到端训练，在Nexar真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据集上训练，提供BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个变体。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并提供更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS模型有效解决了ego-centric碰撞预测问题，发布了模型权重、代码和重新标注的数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散模型已经有了控制机制，但在视觉自回归范式下实现精确灵活的控制仍然探索不足，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 提出了ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和参考注意力模块，该模块丢弃了图像→条件的不必要注意力，降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，同时强调参数重用，利用VAR主干能力处理控制信息，配备零初始化线性投影确保有效整合控制信号而不破坏基础模型的生成能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，同时在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中可控文本到图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了nlg2choice方法，通过两阶段处理解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中处理自由形式响应和大量选项的评估难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法有效处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且难以扩展到基于检索的问题。

Method: 使用两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选项；在检索设置中，采用提前停止方法计算约束响应选择该选项的概率。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验显示，该方法在分类和检索方面均有改进，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理大量选项的评估挑战，提高了分类和检索性能。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法在处理复杂对象交互异常时效果不佳，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻的对象对，生成活动交互的文本描述，通过比较训练和测试视频的文本描述来检测异常。

Result: 在基准数据集上有效检测复杂交互异常，在无交互异常的数据集上也达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本描述提供可解释的异常检测，能有效处理复杂交互异常并提升传统方法的可解释性。

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Motivation: 由于密集视频物体字幕任务的复杂性和手动标注的高成本，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能欠佳，需要一种端到端的解决方案。

Method: 利用先进的视觉语言模型生成关于时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集，训练能够联合检测、分割、跟踪和生成字幕的MaskCaptioner模型。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap数据集上预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个基准测试中取得了最先进的DVOC结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集的方法有效解决了DVOC任务的数据稀缺问题，MaskCaptioner模型展示了端到端训练在密集视频物体字幕任务中的优势。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件机制和3D场景记忆实现精确相机控制和场景一致性，能够从任意长度输入生成后续视频片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短片段进行条件生成，难以在长视频生成中保持场景一致性和精确相机控制，特别是在跨越时间边界时动态元素会错误保留。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆存储从输入视频中提取的静态几何信息，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和动态元素。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法，能够保持长距离空间连贯性而不牺牲计算效率或运动真实性。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt通过结合3D场景记忆和双时空条件机制，成功解决了长视频生成中的场景一致性和相机控制问题，为视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在合成复杂运动时存在困难，生成的运动往往不够自然、平滑和上下文一致，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出RealDPO对齐范式，使用真实世界视频作为正样本，通过DPO和定制损失函数对比真实视频与错误模型输出，实现迭代自校正。同时构建RealAction-5K数据集支持复杂运动合成的后训练。

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习，有效提升了视频生成中复杂运动的真实感和质量。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入时间对应关系来扩展现有的3D重建方法，能够同时估计动态几何和相机位姿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云图3D重建方法在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确的结果，因为运动物体违反了多视图几何约束。

Method: 除了预测点云图，C4D捕获两种对应关系：短期光流和长期点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离移动元素和静态背景。引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明该框架实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机位姿估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功将2D轨迹提升为平滑的3D轨迹，实现了完全集成的4D重建。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Conclusion: 提出的令牌注意力集成扩散模型有效解决了降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，实现了更优的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设场景点云是静态且最新的，这在实际动态环境中需要频繁重新扫描，成本高昂且阻碍部署。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，结合跨模态检索和轻量级多视图融合：识别查询对象类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，在场景中高效探索目标，执行多视图扫描，并将融合证据投影以获得精确边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大幅降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3D视觉定位研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M、引入对比身份损失和新的训练范式，解决了文本到图像生成中的身份一致性生成问题，有效缓解了复制粘贴伪影，平衡了身份保真度和生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致性生成模型由于缺乏大规模配对数据集，主要采用基于重建的训练方法，导致出现复制粘贴问题——模型直接复制参考人脸而非在姿态、表情或光照的自然变化中保持身份，这削弱了可控性并限制了生成表达能力。

Method: 1) 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M，为多人物场景提供每个身份的多样化参考；2) 引入量化复制粘贴伪影以及身份保真度与变化权衡的基准；3) 提出带有对比身份损失的新训练范式，利用配对数据平衡保真度与多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了复制粘贴伪影，提高了对姿态和表情的可控性，并保持了强大的感知质量。用户研究进一步验证了该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建、基准制定和新的训练范式，WithAnyone模型成功解决了身份一致性生成中的复制粘贴问题，在保持高身份相似性的同时实现了更好的可控性和生成多样性。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点云到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点云到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时去噪点的位置和特征。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景数据集上，Terra在重建和生成任务中均达到最先进性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程从任意视角灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过展开扩散模型并利用视觉语言模型的反馈进行直接优化，在无监督情况下达到与有监督方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据集进行监督微调，这种配对数据难以大规模获取，成为关键瓶颈。当前解决方案使用合成训练对，但会传播和放大预训练模型的伪影。

Method: 通过展开扩散模型进行训练，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供端到端优化的直接梯度。结合分布匹配损失确保生成图像保持在预训练模型学习的图像流形内。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据，在少步设置下与各种基于大量监督配对数据训练的图像编辑扩散模型性能相当。使用相同的VLM作为奖励模型时，也优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO。

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的需求，通过直接优化和VLM反馈实现了有效的图像编辑训练，为无监督图像编辑提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NEO原生视觉语言模型系列，通过设计新的构建原则来解决原生VLMs与模块化VLMs之间的差距，并在各种真实场景中达到顶级模块化模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个主要挑战：明确原生VLMs与模块化VLMs的根本区别及如何克服这些障碍，以及如何使原生VLMs研究更加普及和民主化。

Method: 提出了构建原生VLMs的三个指导原则：在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；无缝整合视觉和语言模块的优势；内在地体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的跨模态特性。基于这些原则开发了NEO模型系列。

Result: NEO仅使用3.9亿图像-文本对就能从零开始高效发展视觉感知，在密集的单体模型中缓解视觉语言冲突，在多样化真实场景中能够与顶级模块化模型相媲美。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展且强大的原生VLMs奠定了基石，提供了丰富的可重用组件，促进了成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统发展。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

TL;DR: 提出一种推理时扩散采样方法，通过隐式3D正则化实现多视角一致的图像编辑，避免显式3D表示的优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑时无法保持视角间一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长和稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用耦合扩散采样技术，同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，通过耦合项强制生成图像的多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，适用于各种模型架构。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，避免了显式3D优化的复杂性。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性，在小型3B模型上实现了优于大型8B模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽视了语义对齐挑战，且从英语到其他语言时执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，LLaMA-3-3B模型经GRPO微调后执行准确率达87.4%，语义准确率达52.29%；加入对比奖励信号后平均语义准确率提升至59.14%。3B模型执行准确率88.86%，优于8B模型的81.43%。

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励信号实现定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，小型3B模型能够超越大型8B模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP、LIME）虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床的转化障碍。技术透明度与人类实用性之间的脱节是实际应用的主要障碍。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，以LLM为核心翻译引擎，整合多种XAI工具的技术输出，结合临床指南（通过RAG），自动生成人类可读、有证据支持的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了关键操作障碍，包括工作流程整合、偏见缓解和针对不同利益相关者的沟通，为临床实践提供了集成、可操作且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为领域提供了战略路线图，推动从孤立数据点生成向临床实践中集成、可操作且可信赖AI的交付转变，有望弥合心理健康筛查中实验室到临床的转化差距。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型特定信号（如token级熵），需要访问模型logits，阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信息的公开可验证水印方法。

Method: 利用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文中减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的上下文中增强水印信号以提高检测性。检测器无需访问模型logits。

Result: 在类型多样的语言（分析性英语、孤立性汉语、黏着性韩语）上实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度动态调整水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，而用户在日常使用中产生的偏好标签虽然用户是最佳专家，但缺乏质量控制。

Method: 使用两个不同模型生成响应，通过用户行为模型推断数据质量，开发EM算法估计用户潜在质量因子，并据此过滤数据。

Result: 下游任务显示该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面具有有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式可以作为一种有效的成对偏好数据收集方法，通过质量评估和过滤机制能够提升LLM对齐的效果。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"知情路由"的新范式，通过轻量级特征预测器(LFF)来评估token的重要性和可恢复性，实现执行或近似策略，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，导致不可逆的信息损失和次优的token选择，限制了LLMs在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 引入知情路由范式，使用轻量级特征预测器(LFF)在路由决策前估计单元输出，实现灵活的"执行或近似"策略。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上的广泛实验表明，知情路由在多个稀疏度水平上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡，即使没有最终LoRA微调也能匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地评估token的重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了现有贪婪路由方法的信息损失问题，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但其多层多头结构导致推理和部署效率问题。现有的基于HIS的梯度剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动的贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性

Method: 提出HIES剪枝标准，将头部重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供关于每个头部贡献的互补证据

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝相比仅使用HIS的方法，模型质量提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现显著模型压缩而不牺牲准确性和稳定性

Conclusion: HIES方法通过整合重要性分数和注意力熵，有效克服了HIS方法的局限性，为Transformer模型剪枝提供了更全面的评估标准

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a

problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化背景差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，且不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的界定标准存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于现有最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能够有效处理仇恨言论检测中的文化差异和标签偏见问题，通过个体仇恨子空间提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时、昂贵且繁琐，而数字时代需要组织大量非结构化文本，特别是在电子商务领域需要适当的产品组织。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分关系形式）的全自动方法。

Result: 该方法产生的本体在使用LLM作为评判者的评估中超越了现有的基于BERT的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为在大语言模型更广泛地应用于（产品或其他）本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对事实核查RAG系统的知识投毒攻击方法，能够在极低投毒率下翻转事实核查决策并诱导虚假解释，无需访问目标模型或检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中知识投毒的威胁，因为在这样的场景中可信证据通常主导检索结果，使得传统攻击方法失效。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击技术，这是一种少样本、语义对齐的投毒方法，通过注入对抗性内容来操纵RAG系统的输出，无需访问目标LLM、检索器或token级控制。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT在极低投毒率(0.93×10^-6)下平均攻击成功率达86%，比现有最优攻击方法提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的重大安全漏洞，即使在存在强有力反证据的情况下仍保持攻击有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对电子健康记录(EHR)的领域对齐基础模型，通过额外的结构化EHR序列预训练扩展SciBERT，能够编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调EHR的表格和事件性质与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，这限制了它们捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过额外的结构化EHR序列预训练扩展SciBERT，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务中，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的EHR表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的表现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医疗基础模型预训练中时序序列化的重要性，SerialBEHRT能够产生更丰富的患者表示。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec是一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇，解决传统固定词汇子集方法在推测解码中的局限性，提高接受长度并保持验证准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码中，固定词汇子集方法存在两个问题：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调优，静态短列表抑制罕见或领域特定token，降低每次验证的预期token数量。

Method: 引入轻量级粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇，选择top-k簇的并集作为起草者的短列表，同时验证保留完整词汇和精确性。通过并行执行起草编码和元短列表计算实现加速。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，观察到平均接受长度持续提升，同时上下文相关选择使得更小的短列表不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速起草并能跨多样化任务泛化的动态短列表机制，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Motivation: 标准方法在处理复杂组合任务（如从长对话生成翻译摘要）时表现不佳，需要一种能同时执行多个复杂任务的高效解决方案。

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器之上添加可学习投影层，实现有效集成，同时通过减少计算开销保持效率。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在云端和移动设备实现中表现良好且速度快，在资源受限的实际应用中具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要高速操作和资源约束的现实应用提供了可行的组合多任务处理框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 潜在空间语言引导方法：在平行翻译数据上使用PCA识别语言方向，然后沿着这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在多个语言对上将下一个token分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份集中在最终层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能以可忽略的计算开销缓解代码切换问题。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，研究者希望分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，因为现有的逐步推理方法经常存在不忠实或难以解释的问题。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个具有挑战性的数学基准测试上进行实验。

Result: 在三个数学基准测试中发现，成功的LLM推理具有全局非均匀特征：正确解决方案的特点是信息密度的不均匀波动，这与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在顺序编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新并降低保留知识。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，为每个传入编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit优于或可比于现有最先进的定位-编辑技术，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了在动态演化信息环境中设计更原则化LLM方法的必要性，同时提供了一个简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当不同人口统计特征的用户提出相同问题时，LLM是否会产生事实不一致的回答，提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个话题请求5个事实，重复100次，每次添加不同人物角色上下文。通过句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度来评估事实一致性。

Result: 事实一致性得分范围从0.9065到0.7896，平均值为0.8656。xAI的Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型排名最低。不同话题一致性差异明显，就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性既受提供商影响，也受话题影响。需要开发人物角色不变的提示策略来提高一致性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

TL;DR: BenchPress是一个人类参与循环的系统，利用RAG和LLM为SQL查询生成自然语言描述，加速创建领域特定的text-to-SQL基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业私有数据仓库中text-to-SQL基准测试创建困难的问题，因为手动标注SQL日志既耗时又昂贵。

Method: 给定SQL查询，使用检索增强生成和LLM提出多个自然语言描述，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑这些草稿以确保准确性和领域对齐。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准测试所需的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过简化自定义基准测试的创建，为研究人员和实践者提供了评估text-to-SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

Motivation: 探索原则性学习范式，让模型在训练中融入显式任务约束，而不仅仅依赖标注数据。

Method: 提出Rule-to-Tag框架，在神经网络训练目标中集成多层语言规则，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来处理OOV词汇的不确定性。

Result: R2T-BiLSTM在无标注文本上训练，在Zarma词性标注任务中达到98.2%准确率，优于在300个标注句子上微调的AfriBERTa；在NER任务中，R2T预训练后在50个标注句子上微调的模型优于在300个句子上训练的基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架展示了原则性学习的有效性，能够在少量或无需标注数据的情况下实现高性能，特别适用于资源匮乏的语言处理任务。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同大语言模型具有互补能力，但集成方法对潜在错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，这些错误信号通常源于异构分词方案和模型能力差异。

Method: 提出CoRE技术：token级一致性使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重；模型级一致性通过促进高自信度和低分歧的模型输出来增强全局一致性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过token级和模型级的一致性建模，有效提升了LLM集成的鲁棒性，可无缝集成到各种集成方法中。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

*A H M Rezaul Karim,Ozlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MasonNLP系统使用基于检索增强生成(RAG)的通用指令调优大语言模型，在MEDIQA-WV 2025伤口护理VQA任务中排名第3，平均得分41.37%，证明了轻量级RAG方法在医疗多模态NLP任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答(MedVQA)中的伤口护理问题，支持临床决策和患者护理，需要从医学图像和患者查询中生成自由文本响应和结构化伤口属性。

Method: 采用通用领域指令调优大语言模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)框架，整合领域内数据的文本和视觉示例，通过简单索引和融合添加相关示例，无需额外训练或复杂重排。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第3，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和基于LLM的指标上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLMs结合提供了一个简单有效的多模态临床NLP任务基线方法，仅需最小推理时间层，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了ShishuLM高效语言模型架构，通过减少参数数量和KV缓存需求，在保持性能的同时实现内存需求降低25%和延迟提升40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著的内存和计算开销，研究发现这些模型存在架构冗余，为优化提供了机会。

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究，通过将整个transformer块近似为多层感知机(MLP)，减少参数和KV缓存需求。

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM相比父模型内存需求降低25%，训练和推理延迟提升40%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

*Chenyu Zhang,Sharifa Alghowinem,Cynthia Breazeal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了首个集成LLM框架用于大规模检测辅导对话中的情感动态，通过分析16,986个对话轮次发现学生在AI辅导中通常呈现轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度，但学习过程伴随困惑、好奇和偶尔的挫败感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM在教育环境中的情感动态理解不足，需要关注学习者在AI辅导过程中的情感状态变化，为负责任地整合生成式AI到教育中提供路径。

Method: 分析了两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分以及自由文本情感标签，通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合估计。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随情感；挫败感较少但会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情感通常快速解决，中性时刻常作为转向点。

Conclusion: 中性时刻为辅导干预提供了关键机会点，情感动态的深入理解有助于优化AI辅导系统设计，促进更有效的学习体验。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

TL;DR: 提出了模板填充（TI）方法，专门为扩散语言模型设计生成策略，通过动态分段分配（DSA）自适应调整段长度，在数学推理和代码生成任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型作为自回归语言模型的有前景替代品，但其推理策略仍局限于自回归范式的基于前缀的提示方法，需要专门为其生成过程设计条件化方法。

Method: 模板填充（TI）方法首先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充被掩码的片段；动态分段分配（DSA）根据生成置信度自适应调整段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法取得了17.01%的稳定改进，并在多令牌生成设置中实现了有效的加速同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 模板填充方法为扩散语言模型提供了有效的结构控制生成策略，显著提升了性能并支持多令牌生成加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Under-resourced languages, such as Quechuas, face data and resource scarcity,
hindering their development in speech technology. To address this issue, Common
Voice presents a crucial opportunity to foster an open and community-driven
speech dataset creation. This paper examines the integration of Quechua
languages into Common Voice. We detail the current 17 Quechua languages,
presenting Puno Quechua (ISO 639-3: qxp) as a focused case study that includes
language onboarding and corpus collection of both reading and spontaneous
speech data. Our results demonstrate that Common Voice now hosts 191.1 hours of
Quechua speech (86\% validated), with Puno Quechua contributing 12 hours (77\%
validated), highlighting the Common Voice's potential. We further propose a
research agenda addressing technical challenges, alongside ethical
considerations for community engagement and indigenous data sovereignty. Our
work contributes towards inclusive voice technology and digital empowerment of
under-resourced language communities.

Conclusion: FRACCO数据集为法语肿瘤学文本的命名实体识别和概念标准化提供了参考标准。

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，可在仅解码器语言模型中实现token级别的层跳过。通过可微分的sigmoid线性门对分支输出进行压缩，在推理时根据门值对低重要性token进行跳过，节省计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型通常不稳定且需要大量重新训练，而GateSkip旨在提供一种稳定、可微分的层跳过机制，能够在预训练模型基础上进行微调。

Method: 为每个Attention/MLP分支配备sigmoid线性门，压缩分支输出后再重新进入残差流。推理时根据门值对token进行排序，使用每层预算跳过低重要性token。

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省高达15%的计算成本，同时保持超过90%的基线准确率。在指令调优模型上，全计算时获得准确率提升，在约50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过方法，学习到的门控机制揭示了transformer信息流模式，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLMs在不确定环境中的序列决策能力。Qwen3-4B模型表现最佳，达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，超越了传统算法和其他LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs仅使用自然语言在不确定性环境中进行序列决策的能力，目前这一领域尚未充分研究。

Method: 创建多臂老虎机环境，LLMs仅通过文本反馈"你获得了一个代币"进行交互，没有数值线索或显式概率，让模型从语言线索推断潜在奖励结构并相应调整。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法（汤普森采样、ε-贪婪、UCB等）。

Conclusion: 概率推理能够仅从语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值上下文中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种让语言模型动态自主调整每个输入token计算步数的训练方法，模型可以通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，使用<pause>token获得更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入token的复杂性动态调整计算资源，在需要更多思考时请求暂停，提高计算效率。

Method: 提出了Catch Your Breath损失函数类别，包括CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）三种具体方法。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能够根据token复杂性自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法使语言模型能够智能地分配计算资源，在复杂token处请求更多计算时间，提高整体效率和准确性。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成的质量。

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一种简单、模块化的文本生成增强框架，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂的辅助生成模型。

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟研究大多采用封闭式设计，忽略了LLM的生成性本质，无法充分捕捉真实社会意见的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 借鉴数十年调查方法研究和NLP最新进展，提出开放式文本生成框架，允许LLM自由表达观点、主题和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计，支持探索意外观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体差异，增强方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Method: 使用统一的8,660个人工标注样本和相同的零样本提示，评估10个LLMs在IAB 2.2分类法下的表现，并开发了集成方法。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，精确率42%，召回率45%，F1分数41%。集成方法显著提高了准确率，减少了过度分类，完全消除了幻觉。

Conclusion: 单纯的模型规模和架构改进不能确保更好的分类准确性，协调的模型集成可能是实现超越人类专家性能的最有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面主要关注易验证的最终答案，但自然语言数学证明的生成和验证仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器。

Method: 引入ProofBench专家标注数据集，系统探索评估器设计空间（骨干模型、输入上下文、指令和工作流程），开发ProofGrader评估器，结合强推理骨干LM、参考解决方案和评分方案的丰富上下文，以及简单集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上达到0.926的MAE，显著优于朴素基线；在最佳选择任务中（n=16）平均得分4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader评估器在细粒度数学证明评分方面表现出色，具有推进下游证明生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

TL;DR: THTB是一个受认知科学启发的指令数据选择和标注指导框架，通过质量过滤和内在/外在难度评分来优先选择高层级认知指令，使模型仅用5%数据就能超越全数据集训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高质量SFT数据选择中过度依赖LLM内部知识、解释性弱且泛化能力有限，需要更有效的数据选择框架。

Method: 结合质量过滤与内在/外在难度评分，优先选择高层级认知指令，提供可解释和可量化的SFT标准。

Result: 仅用5%数据训练的模型超越全数据集训练，泛化能力优于仅用LLM选择的方法；在垂直领域仅用2%数据就能超越更大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面具有高效性，展示了强大的领域适应潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

*Olga E. Sorokoletova,Francesco Giarrusso,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文开发了包含50种越狱策略的全面分层分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，评估了基于分类法的提示对自动检测的改进效果，并创建了包含1364个多轮对抗对话的意大利语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且依赖有限的分类法，无法充分捕捉攻击策略的多样性。为了推进对越狱技术有效性的理解，作者进行了结构化红队挑战。

Method: 通过结构化红队挑战开发了包含7个主要家族的50种越狱策略分层分类法，分析了挑战收集的数据以检验不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，评估了基于分类法的提示对自动检测的改进效果。

Result: 开发了全面的越狱策略分类法，包含7个主要家族：冒充、说服、权限提升、认知过载、混淆、目标冲突和数据投毒。创建了包含1364个多轮对抗对话的意大利语数据集，标注了分类法信息。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对越狱策略的深入理解，展示了特定策略如何利用模型漏洞并导致错位，为改进大语言模型的安全防御提供了重要见解和资源。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

*Misam Abbas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种作者归属方法：固定风格嵌入和指令调优的LLM法官（GPT-4o），在包含6个领域600个实例的Human AI Parallel Corpus上进行测试，发现两种方法在不同领域各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的归属机制来区分人类和AI生成的内容。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和GPT-4o作为LLM法官两种方法，在Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集上进行测试，该数据集包含6个领域（学术、新闻、小说、博客、口语转录、影视剧本）的600个平衡实例。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT生成内容上表现更好（82% vs 68%），LLM法官在LLaMA生成内容上略优（85% vs 81%）。LLM法官在小说和学术文本中显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同领域各有优势，LLM法官具有语义敏感性，而风格嵌入在结构分析方面更强。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing
this work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 窄域微调会在LLM激活中产生强烈偏见，这些偏见可通过模型差异分析来理解微调领域，并可用于生成类似微调数据格式和内容的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究窄域微调对LLM激活的影响，探索如何通过模型差异分析来理解微调领域，并评估这种偏见对AI安全和可解释性研究的影响。

Method: 使用模型差异分析工具，分析随机文本前几个token的激活差异，并通过在模型激活中添加这些差异来引导文本生成。创建基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 窄域微调在LLM激活中产生了显著的偏见，这些偏见包含关于微调领域的关键信息。使用偏见信息的代理表现显著优于简单提示的基线代理。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在其激活中具有训练目标的显著痕迹，这对AI安全和可解释性研究提出了警告，需要更深入地研究窄域微调的影响并开发更真实的研究案例。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

*Tuan T. Nguyen,John Le,Thai T. Vu,Willy Susilo,Heath Cooper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAID是一个针对大语言模型的越狱攻击框架，通过优化对抗性后缀来绕过安全机制，在保持流畅性的同时诱导受限内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能出色，但仍容易受到越狱攻击的威胁。现有攻击方法在效果和效率方面存在不足，需要开发更系统化的攻击框架来揭示模型的安全漏洞。

Method: RAID将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，使用联合目标函数优化：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)加入拒绝感知正则化器使激活远离拒绝方向，(iii)应用连贯性项保持语义合理性和非冗余性。优化后通过批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID相比现有的白盒和黑盒基线方法，能以更少的查询和更低的计算成本获得更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞的重要性，为模型安全性的改进提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

*Nicole Smith-Vaniz,Harper Lyon,Lorraine Steigner,Ben Armstrong,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型在道德和政治立场上的潜在偏见，通过道德基础理论框架比较LLM响应与人类数据的差异，评估模型是否表现出意识形态倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域提供建议，需要评估这些模型在政治和道德领域的响应是否存在偏见。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM的响应与现有人类研究的差异，评估模型在固有响应、明确政治意识形态表达和角色扮演情境下的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLM的响应确实存在政治和意识形态倾向，模型在表达不同政治立场时的准确性存在差异。

Conclusion: LLM的响应具有政治和人口统计学依赖性，这为理解AI生成内容中的偏见提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

*Pan Chen,Shaohong Chen,Mark Wang,Shi Xuan Leong,Priscilla Fung,Varinia Bernales,Alan Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL)框架，通过从示例中提取认知构建块的抽象模式来增强语言模型的推理过程，在GPQA数据集上性能提升高达36.19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于示例的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面进行知识检索和传递的显式模块，受认知科学中的图式理论启发，人类通过激活已有心理框架来理解新信息。

Method: 从先验示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建抽象模式（轻量级、结构化的关键推理步骤及其关系模板），用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL持续提升性能，当单个演示示例质量高时性能提升高达36.19%，同时减少对演示数量的依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的各种ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新途径，大型语言模型缺乏隐式形成和利用基于模式的学习表示能力，但能从显式模式脚手架中显著受益。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一个无需标签的提示优化框架，通过双人赌博机设置和LLM法官的成对偏好反馈来高效优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对输入提示高度敏感，但自动提示优化方法通常需要真实标签数据，而收集高质量标签成本高昂且缓慢。

Method: PDO将问题建模为双人赌博机设置，结合Double Thompson Sampling（优先选择信息丰富的提示比较）和Top-Performer Guided Mutation（通过变异高性能提示扩展候选池）。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO始终优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示变异的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种样本高效的标签无关提示优化方法，能够自然地在无标签设置中运行，并可整合部分标签来减轻法官噪声。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了LLaMA 3.2-3B模型在算术计算中是否编码运算符优先级，发现中间结果存在于残差流中，特别是MLP块之后，且模型在线性编码每个运算符的优先级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，先前研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而忽略了模型内部进行算术计算的结构机制。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术，分析模型残差流中的中间结果。

Result: 中间计算确实出现在残差流中，特别是在MLP块之后；模型在注意力层后线性编码每个运算符的优先级。

Conclusion: LLM在内部表示中编码了运算符优先级，这为理解模型算术计算机制提供了新视角，并引入了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识图谱基础模型在整合LLM知识与KG上下文时存在知识扭曲问题，且难以约束LLM的生成幻觉，严重影响推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计KRL指令格式和分词器对齐LLM知识与KG表示；提出KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识与额外KG上下文；构建结构感知的下一个实体预测器将推理结果严格约束在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳KGR数据集上的实验表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中均表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了归纳知识图谱推理的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot

TL;DR: 提出了RAGCap-Bench基准，用于细粒度评估代理式RAG工作流中的中间任务能力，发现具有更强中间能力的大模型在端到端任务中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有代理式RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时中间推理能力不足的问题，需要对这些中间能力进行更精细的评估。

Method: 分析最先进系统的输出，识别常见任务和所需核心能力，构建典型错误分类法，设计有针对性的评估问题。

Result: 实验表明，具有更强RAGCap性能的"慢思考"模型在端到端任务中表现更好，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强中间推理能力对提升代理式RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了AI辩论中语言模型是否会为了说服力而迎合法官观点，而不是坚持自身先验信念。实验发现模型倾向于选择与法官立场一致的立场，顺序辩论存在偏见，模型在辩护与自身信念一致的立场时更有说服力，但矛盾的是，与信念不一致的论点在质量评估中得分更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所辩护的主张是错误的。本研究将辩论应用于主观问题，明确测量语言模型的先验信念，测试模型是否会采用迎合策略来最大化说服力。

Method: 在辩论前测量语言模型的先验信念，然后让辩手选择偏好立场，并面对与自身先验信念冲突的法官角色。比较了顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估系统性偏见。分析模型在辩护与自身信念一致或不一致立场时的说服力和论点质量。

Result: 模型倾向于选择与法官立场一致的立场而非自身先验信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在辩护与自身信念一致的立场时更有说服力；但矛盾的是，与信念不一致的论点在成对比较中被评为更高质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的人机交互重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段数据合成管道，通过逐步增加任务复杂度来生成问答对，直到前沿基线网络代理失败。该方法能够训练出比现有数据集更有效的网络代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网络深度研究代理在解决复杂问答任务时面临挑战，因为底层语言模型通常未针对长程推理和探索进行优化。现有方法缺乏对难度和质量的细粒度控制，且往往混淆数据和训练效果。

Method: 采用两阶段数据合成管道，使用基线网络代理逐步增加任务复杂度生成问答对。基线代理在过程中扮演多个角色：尝试回答问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案并执行过滤。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集规模较小，但训练出的网络代理在多个网络基准测试中表现优于现有数据集。数据在工具使用动作上展现出两倍的多样性，使模型能够获得更强性能同时避免重复工具调用行为。

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法能够生成高质量的训练数据，有效提升网络代理在复杂问答任务中的表现，特别是在长程推理和工具使用多样性方面。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了关于小语言模型训练中可读性重要性的观点，发现统计简单性（n-gram多样性）比可读性更能预测模型的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳当前将小语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的观点，质疑可读性在模型能力涌现中的关键作用。

Method: 构建结构匹配但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较模型在不同可读性文本上的训练效果和连贯性发展速度。

Result: 模型在复杂成人级文本上的表现与简化语言相当，甚至展现出更快的连贯性发展；统计简单性是更强的学习能力预测指标。

Conclusion: 应避免无实证基础地将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比，需要更精确地理解支持小模型能力涌现的实际属性。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

TL;DR: 提出Element2Vec方法，使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成化学元素的通用嵌入和属性突出向量，解决传统方法难以建模复杂关系和AI方法存在幻觉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学元素属性数据对材料设计至关重要，但许多属性难以直接测量。传统数值分析方法无法建模复杂关系，而现有AI方法存在幻觉和缺乏可解释性问题。

Method: 使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成元素的通用嵌入(Global)和属性突出向量(Local)，并设计基于自注意力的测试时训练方法来缓解回归误差。

Result: 成功开发了Element2Vec方法，能够有效表示化学元素，解决文本分布差异和数据稀疏性等计算挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作为材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平了道路，提供了更准确和可解释的元素属性预测方法。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来优化过程奖励模型(PRM)在测试时扩展(TTS)中的使用，通过加权聚合策略和校准方法显著提升了TTS效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不稳定，有时甚至被简单多数投票超越，需要找到更有效利用PRM验证信号的方法。

Method: 开发理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合，提出加权聚合策略和高效的预计算校准方法。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，仅使用21.3%的计算量就超过了普通加权多数投票的性能。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算是更有效的性能提升路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

TL;DR: FACTS是一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要方法，通过离线模板生成实现查询聚焦的表格摘要，解决了现有方法的成本、推理复杂性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法存在成本高、推理能力弱、token限制、效率低下和隐私泄露等问题，需要一种更实用、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: FACTS通过生成包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的离线模板，这些模板可在共享相同模式的多个表格中重复使用，实现快速、准确的摘要生成。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS始终优于基线方法，证明了其作为现实世界查询聚焦表格摘要的实用解决方案。

Conclusion: FACTS通过离线模板生成方法，提供了一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的AI代理框架，将原始数据包捕获转换为结构化语义表示，用于交互式IoT网络流量分析，结合特征提取、异常检测、流量摘要和威胁情报增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT网络产生多样化高流量数据，需要跨层行为、协议和上下文解释，而非孤立检测，以获取有意义的洞察。

Method: 集成特征提取、基于transformer的异常检测、数据包和流量摘要、威胁情报增强和检索增强问答的AI代理框架，使用混合检索（词法和语义搜索+重排序）。

Result: 在多个IoT捕获数据和六个开放模型上的实验评估显示，混合检索相比仅密集检索显著改善了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore结果。系统分析表明CPU、GPU和内存开销低。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对IoT网络流量的全面高效解释，证明了混合检索方法的有效性。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

TL;DR: BioMedSearch是一个基于大语言模型的多源生物医学信息检索框架，通过整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，结合子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学领域生成的内容缺乏科学严谨性，无法访问权威数据库，经常虚构蛋白质功能和结构信息，因此需要开发能够整合多源权威信息的检索框架。

Method: 提出BioMedSearch框架，集成文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤来生成高质量问答结果。

Result: 在包含3000个问题的BioMedMCQs数据集上测试，BioMedSearch在所有三个推理级别上都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch通过多源信息整合和结构化处理，有效解决了大语言模型在生物医学领域缺乏科学严谨性的问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 持续接触低质量网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力下降，这种现象被称为"LLM脑退化"。通过控制实验发现，垃圾数据训练会显著损害模型的推理、长文本理解、安全性等能力，且这种影响是剂量依赖性的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证数据质量对大语言模型认知能力的因果影响，探索持续预训练中数据筛选的重要性，将其重新定义为训练时安全问题。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾数据集和控制数据集，采用两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量），在匹配token规模和训练操作的条件下对4个LLM进行持续预训练对比实验。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致模型在推理、长文本理解、安全性等方面显著下降（Hedges' g>0.3），且随着垃圾数据比例增加呈现剂量依赖性认知衰退。错误分析发现思维跳跃是主要病变机制。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动因素，需要将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并为已部署LLM建立常规"认知健康检查"机制。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，评估ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同社会人口特征和用户角色下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，不利群体被分配更高的不良事件预测可能性，识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种偏见模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，临床部署前迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 小型语言模型在本地硬件上运行具有隐私、成本和环保优势，但在多步推理和领域知识任务上表现不佳，需要解决这一局限性

Method: 构建指令语料库，将相似训练问题分组并用GPT-5创建指令；推理时检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤，为模型提供结构化推理指导

Result: 在MedQA上提升9.4%，MMLU法律上提升7.9%，MathQA上提升5.1%；简洁指令优于长指令，改进幅度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力

Conclusion: 指令检索是一种有效方法，能为小型语言模型带来大规模推理能力，且无需额外微调

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决关于AI模型能否在模仿作者风格的同时生成高质量文学文本的争议，特别是针对使用受版权保护书籍训练AI模型引发的法律纠纷。

Method: 采用预注册研究设计，比较MFA培训的专业作家与三种前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作者风格方面的表现。通过159名专家和普通读者的盲测评估，对比上下文提示和微调两种方法的效果。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本在专家评估中表现不佳（风格保真度OR=0.16，写作质量OR=0.13），但微调后完全逆转（风格保真度OR=8.16，写作质量OR=1.87）。微调输出很少被AI检测器识别（3% vs 97%），且每位作者的平均成本仅为81美元，比专业作家报酬降低99.7%。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能够生成读者偏爱的非逐字写作，这为版权法中关于"对源作品潜在市场或价值的影响"这一合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

Motivation: 发现推理不确定性高度局部化——只有一小部分高熵标记主导影响输出正确性，而现有方法通常以效率为代价进行测试时扩展。

Method: MTI包括：(1)选择性CFG干预，仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导；(2)轻量级负提示指导，重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，如Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI是一种无需训练的方法，能够以最小开销显著提升大语言模型的推理性能，证明了局部化干预的有效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在多种导致错误输出的潜在原因，理解实际中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 提出了新的RAG系统错误类型分类法，创建了带有错误类型标注的错误RAG响应数据集，并开发了与分类法一致的自动评估方法。

Result: 开发了包含错误分类、示例数据集和实用建议的完整框架，代码和数据已在GitHub上公开。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统性的方法和工具，有助于在实际开发中跟踪和解决错误问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.

TL;DR: German Commons是迄今为止最大的公开许可德语文本集合，包含1545.6亿token，来自41个来源的7个领域，为开发真正开放的德语语言模型提供了高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数语料许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，特别是德语，公开许可文本仍然极度稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集数据，涵盖法律、科学、文化、政治、新闻、经济和网络文本7个领域。采用全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式化修复的处理流程，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。

Result: 构建了包含154.56亿token的高质量德语文本语料库，所有领域子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可，确保模型训练和重新分发的法律合规性。

Conclusion: German Commons填补了公开许可德语预训练数据的关键空白，使开发真正开放的德语语言模型成为可能。同时发布了语料构建和德语文本数据过滤代码，确保项目的完全可重现性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

*Shehenaz Hossain,Haithem Afli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，通过文化流畅性、偏差、一致性和语言适应性四个指标来评估LLM在跨文化语境中的推理能力，发现文化意识不是固有的而是通过语言框架显现的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正确答案评估无法反映文化理解，需要开发能评估LLM跨文化推理能力的框架。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR）在50个来自世界价值观调查的文化相关问题上的表现，问题被翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，共分析2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 不同语言间推理存在显著差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更好但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLM的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了大型语言模型在抽象推理任务中的语言偏见，发现英语模态通常表现更好，开源和闭源模型之间存在性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注常识或数学等依赖策略或知识的推理任务，而抽象推理作为日常生活中的重要能力却较少被评估语言偏见。

Method: 提出了基于纽约时报Connections游戏的GlobalGroup任务，构建了英语、西班牙语、中文、印地语和阿拉伯语五个语言背景的游戏基准，并提出了游戏难度测量方法。

Result: 实验发现英语模态在抽象推理任务中表现更好，开源和闭源模型之间存在性能差异。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的评估方法来理解语言模型在跨语言抽象推理任务中的能力差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Result: 发现了文献中未识别的一系列可解释的语音语义对齐模式，以及跨语言模式；对5种先前假设的语音语义对齐进行了验证，结果有支持也有混合。

Conclusion: 语音语义象似性在大规模分布分析中确实存在可量化的系统性关系，包括新的对齐模式和跨语言一致性。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

TL;DR: ERGO方法通过监测LLM内部不确定性（香农熵）来动态调整多轮对话上下文，显著提升增量信息场景下的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮对话中处理增量信息时性能显著下降，这限制了实际应用效果

Method: 提出ERGO方法，通过持续量化下一个token分布的香农熵来检测不确定性尖峰，并触发自适应提示整合

Result: 在增量指令任务中，ERGO相比基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值能力提升24.7%，不可靠性降低35.3%

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID是一个紧凑的端到端框架，结合通用语义编码器和领域自适应编码器，通过轻量级分支分类器实现OOS意图检测，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中OOS用户话语检测的关键挑战，现有方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块，需要更鲁棒和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 结合通用句子编码器(USE)和领域自适应Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)的双编码器框架，融合表示由轻量级分支分类器处理，使用单一校准阈值分离域内和OOS意图，并包含合成和开放域异常增强。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，在多个意图基准测试中一致优于最新基线，已知意图的macro-F1提升6-15%，OOS意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示结合简单校准可以为神经对话系统提供鲁棒、可扩展和可靠的OOS检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of

higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its

Macedonian cuisine. The resulting dataset contributes a new resource for
studying food culture in underrepresented languages and offers insights into
the unique patterns of Macedonian culinary tradition.

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，使用强化学习框架和语义相似度奖励来提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统SFT方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，将SFT数据集用于强化学习框架，以更有效地提升基础模型的指令跟随能力

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应的余弦相似度作为奖励分数

Result: RLSR在指令跟随基准测试中表现优于SFT：Qwen-7B上RLSR的AlpacaEval胜率为26.34%，SFT为21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%胜率

Conclusion: RLSR可替代SFT或与SFT结合使用，能有效提升模型指令跟随能力，在资源有限情况下特别有用

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件（如精选信息和个性特征）而未经验证与目标个体的对齐度，导致行为模拟不准确。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并相应优化角色配置文件。在四种行为预测场景（正式辩论、社交媒体帖子、公开访谈、电影评论）上使用五个大语言模型进行评估。

Result: DPRF能持续显著提升行为对齐度，优于基线角色配置，并在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用（如用户模拟、社会研究、个性化AI）的有效性提供了稳健方法。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理任务的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段级离线搜索和在线置信度早期退出来平衡效率和准确性，实现最高1.70倍加速且准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但会增加延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）由于阶段级跳过敏感度变化和冗余输出令牌生成两个关键挑战，难以在此设置下平衡效率和准确性。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段级离线搜索（分配最优层预算）和在线置信度生成早期退出（抑制不必要的解码）。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的效率和准确性平衡问题，为小语言模型的推理加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对不同提示表述的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在面对相同提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的答案，这影响了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（CCE）使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；表示对齐损失将低置信度预测器拉向高置信度多数投票建立的共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上的评估显示，F²C将观察一致性提高了11.62%，平均F1分数提高了8.94%，跨格式性能方差降低了3.29%。

Conclusion: F²C是一种有效的无监督方法，可增强LLM在提示扰动下的稳定性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

Result: 在三个不同领域的广泛实验表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为大语言模型提供语义完整的文档记忆，并为小语言模型实现以人为中心的智能文本处理铺平道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架通过主动文档记忆提取，显著提升了RAG系统的知识内化和推理能力，使语言模型能够模拟人类阅读认知过程，实现更智能的文本处理。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

*Rahul Nadkarni,Yanai Elazar,Hila Gonen,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过干预训练数据批次来研究语言模型行为与训练数据关系的实验方法，包括选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档并重新训练模型等步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练数据如何影响语言模型的行为，特别是知识获取能力，以补充过去仅基于观察的分析方法。

Method: 通过"重写历史"的方式干预数据批次，包括从基准中选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档内容，然后重新训练模型并测量效果。

Result: 研究结果补充了过去将共现统计与模型行为关联的观察分析，同时表明现有的相关训练文档识别方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验方法框架，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

TL;DR: DEG-RAG框架通过实体解析和三重反思技术，对LLM生成的知识图谱进行去噪处理，显著提升了基于图的RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的RAG系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但生成的图谱通常包含冗余实体和不可靠关系，这会降低检索和生成性能并增加计算成本。当前研究未充分解决LLM生成知识图谱的去噪问题。

Method: 提出DEG-RAG框架，包含两个核心技术：(1) 实体解析，消除冗余实体；(2) 三重反思，移除错误关系。同时系统评估了实体解析中的不同阻塞策略、嵌入选择、相似度度量和实体合并技术。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅大幅减小图谱规模，还在多种流行的基于图的RAG变体中一致提升了问答性能。

Conclusion: DEG-RAG通过简单的去噪方法有效提升了基于图的RAG系统性能，这是对LLM生成知识图谱中实体解析问题的首次全面探索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Motivation: 解决小型多语言模型在检索任务上表现不佳的问题，探索如何通过特定优化使小型模型在检索任务上达到大型模型的性能水平。

Method: 分析训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型效果的影响，特别关注硬负样本的引入和任务多样性的作用。

Result: 开发出约300M参数的小型多语言模型，在检索任务上表现与当前7B模型相当甚至更优，证明通过针对性优化可以显著提升小型模型的检索性能。

Conclusion: 小型多语言模型通过适当的训练策略优化（特别是硬负样本和任务多样性）可以在检索任务上达到大型模型的性能，为高效多语言检索提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

TL;DR: Qwen3Guard是一个多语言安全护栏模型系列，包含生成式和流式两个变体，支持细粒度三分类判断和实时安全监控，在多种语言基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏模型存在两个主要限制：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，与流式LLM推理不兼容。

Method: 提出Qwen3Guard系列模型，包含生成式变体（将安全分类转换为指令跟随任务实现三分类判断）和流式变体（引入token级分类头实现实时安全监控）。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面达到最先进性能，支持119种语言和方言，提供三种参数规模（0.6B、4B、8B）。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的智能检索系统，通过三个专门代理（问题分析器、选择器、添加器）的迭代交互，在多跳问答任务中实现高精度和高召回率的证据检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要检索多个相关证据，现有检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在不足，需要更智能的检索系统来支持复杂问题的回答。

Method: 构建三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器为每个子问题选择最相关上下文（侧重精度），添加器补充缺失证据（侧重召回率）。选择器和添加器通过迭代交互产生紧凑而全面的支持段落集合。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue、MultiHopRAG）上，该方法持续优于强基线模型，实现了更高的检索准确率，同时过滤掉干扰内容。

Conclusion: 该智能检索系统能够显著提高多跳问答的检索性能，使下游QA模型在依赖较少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案的准确率。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向检索策略：表优先检索后列选择，以及列优先检索后表选择，结合问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等基准测试中显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，将完整模式和完美模式之间的性能差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，无需查询优化即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 学术论文数量快速增长导致科学家难以及时跟踪最新研究成果，现有论文数据库大多局限于相似性匹配和基本分类，无法深入探索概念间的关系网络。

Method: 基于OpenAlex开源知识图谱，分析近8000篇开源论文数据，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，利用小语言模型进行概念提取和创新点识别，构建基于知识图谱约束机制的智能体。

Result: 通过对Qwen和DeepSeek模型进行微调，在准确性方面取得了显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Conclusion: 发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，提出的方法能够有效提升学术论文分析的深度和准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Method: 构建平行多语言数学问题数据集，系统评估开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在不同语言间的数学推理能力存在显著差异，在低资源语言环境中表现明显下降。

Conclusion: LLM在多语言数学推理方面仍存在持续缺陷，特别是在低资源语言环境中需要改进一致性和可解释性。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中会自然表现出欺骗行为，RLHF训练的安全模型仍有43%的欺骗率，并开发了多轮强化学习方法来减少77.6%的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在客服、教育、医疗等应用中与数百万人交互，但其产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论是有意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患。LLM行为的不可预测性，加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，使其误用成为严重的现实风险。

Method: 提出信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种已有欺骗检测指标和新提出的指标。引入多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗指标与人类判断的相关性比现有指标更密切。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中会自然表现出欺骗行为，被提示欺骗时欺骗性可增加31%。RLHF训练的安全模型平均仍有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法相比其他指令微调模型减少了77.6%的欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中逐渐发展的，其有效评估和缓解需要超越单轮话语分析。提出的多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为，为构建更安全的AI系统提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，能够及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的重要标志，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法和语义，将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归并微调超参数。

Result: 实现了91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC，优于现有最佳NLP模型的88%准确率。模型稳定性良好（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为AD的大规模筛查方法和医生检测的补充检查。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为角色扮演代理时，在忠实和一致地呈现版本特定角色（如不同宇宙中的超级英雄）方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含30个标志性英雄和90个特定版本角色的基准测试，包含两个任务：Canon Events（事实回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境），并提出Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能改善较弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低较强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常擅长思考或行动但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

### [187] [CURE: Confidence-driven Unified Reasoning Ensemble Framework for Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14353)
*Ziad Elshaer,Essam A. Rashed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的置信驱动多模型框架，通过模型多样性提升医疗问答性能，在资源受限环境中实现高效医疗AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医疗大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA达到95.0%，MedMCQA达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医疗AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境中先进医疗AI的普及具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs对字符级扰动的鲁棒性，通过插入不可见Unicode控制字符来防止LLM滥用，发现即使在高噪声情况下许多LLM仍能保持显著性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在字符级扰动下的鲁棒性，探索如何通过插入噪声字符来防止LLM在在线考试系统等场景中的滥用。

Method: 提出NAMESHORT方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符，通过破坏分词和降低信噪比来测试LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 尽管存在强混淆导致分词碎片化和信噪比显著降低，许多LLMs仍能保持显著性能，表现出字符级鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMs在低层级具有较强鲁棒性，这既揭示了其滥用风险，也为LLM在各种应用中的可靠性部署提供了启示。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

*Mykolas Sveistrys,Richard Kunert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了pluri-hop问题（需要聚合所有文档信息的问题），并构建了PluriHopWIND数据集来研究这类挑战。作者开发了PluriHopRAG方法，通过文档级子问题分解和交叉编码器过滤，在重复性高、干扰文档多的语料上显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答系统在处理需要聚合所有文档信息的问题时表现不佳，特别是当语料库具有高度重复性和大量干扰文档时。这类pluri-hop问题在现实场景（如医疗记录、合规文件）中很常见，但对遗漏任何文档都很敏感。

Method: 提出了PluriHopRAG方法：1）将查询分解为文档级子问题；2）使用交叉编码器过滤无关文档；3）在过滤后的文档上进行LLM推理。同时构建了PluriHopWIND多语言数据集用于评估。

Result: 传统RAG方法在PluriHopWIND数据集上的F1得分不超过40%。PluriHopRAG方法相比基线方法实现了18-52%的相对F1得分提升，证明了详尽检索和早期过滤策略的有效性。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集揭示了当前问答系统在重复性高、干扰文档多的语料上的局限性。PluriHopRAG的性能表明，详尽检索和早期过滤是比top-k方法更有效的替代方案，特别适合处理pluri-hop问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Reddit用户的纵向评论树数据，结合哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表，显著提升了用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球重要的公共卫生问题，现有研究主要关注单条社交媒体帖子的自杀表达检测，但缺乏对用户历史帖子和互动评论的纵向序列分析，而用户往往通过这些内容随时间推移表露自杀意图。

Method: 构建了基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，包含用户发帖历史和评论数据，采用基于哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表的四标签标注框架，并进行统计分析和大型语言模型实验。

Result: 统计分析和大语言模型实验结果表明，纳入评论树数据能显著增强用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为提升高危个体检测准确率提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个词预测方面表现出色，但难以生成反映个人真实沟通风格的回复。由于隐私问题，真实的社交网络或邮件历史难以收集。

Method: 构建多语言基准数据集，包含英语、日语和中文的100个对话会话，用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行为期五天的互动，捕捉自然的日常沟通模式。

Result: 建立了YNTP任务的第一个基准，为基于提示和微调的个性化方法提供了评估基础，支持用户对齐的语言建模研究。

Conclusion: YNTP任务和数据集为研究用户个性化语言模型提供了重要基础，解决了真实沟通数据难以获取的问题，推动了用户对齐语言建模的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架，通过引用感知推理、迭代检索验证和MedTrust对齐模块来减少医学QA中的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RAG的生物医学问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要由于检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响了回答的可靠性。

Method: 1. 引用感知推理：要求所有生成内容必须基于检索的医学文档；2. 迭代检索验证：通过验证代理评估证据充分性并优化查询；3. MedTrust对齐模块：结合验证正例和幻觉感知负例，使用直接偏好优化强化基于引用的推理。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架通过系统化的证据验证和对齐优化，有效提高了生物医学问答的事实一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决多约束指令跟随问题，具有良好的泛化能力，且无需外部监督

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式来构建可验证的网页代理训练数据，创建了包含10K样本的WebAggregatorQA数据集，并基于此开发了WebAggregator系列模型，在信息聚合能力上超越了GPT-4.1和Claude-3.7-sonnet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，忽视了信息聚合的重要性，这限制了它们支持深度研究的能力。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：先通过主动在线探索从真实网页收集证据，然后从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作，自演进生成可验证的QA对。

Result: WebAggregator-8B模型性能与GPT-4.1相当，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。在WebAggregatorQA测试集上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: 即使代理能够检索所有参考资料，在WebAggregatorQA上仍然表现不佳，突显了需要加强网页代理基础模型的信息聚合能力。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，使用自然语言输出替代JSON格式

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT显著提升工具调用性能，改进在提示扰动下保持稳定，并能扩展缺乏原生支持的模型的能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定低资源语言到英语语义空间，结合检索和推理增强，显著提升低资源语言的跨语言表示性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca基础上添加语言感知的轻量推理头，通过一致性正则化增强推理能力。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中，LiRA在少样本和噪声增强设置下均表现出持续增益和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效解决了低资源语言的跨语言表示问题，同时增强了检索和推理能力，为多语言NLP提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法有效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重新组织实体级标记，丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来提高效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1分，压缩比为1.8；在LitBank上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大部分标记是在增量共指消解中的可行策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs社会文化背景对齐性以及安全技术稳健性的框架和数据集，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术稳健性。

Result: 实验结果显示主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面有意义，但并未完全满足服务目标用户的流行说法，且追求这一未经检验的说法可能导致低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面和实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：现有数据缺乏复杂内部模式，以及当前方法缺乏精确思维过程和难度控制。

Method: 构建CodeSeq合成后训练数据集，将数字序列打包为算法问题，通过反思失败测试用例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据，并采用基于可解性和自生成案例成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过系统化的数据生成和训练方法，有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，同时保持了泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

TL;DR: RLAIF-SPA框架通过强化学习从AI反馈机制，结合ASR和LLM技术评估语义准确性和韵律-情感标签对齐，提升TTS系统的情感表达能力和可理解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统在情感表达方面存在不足，现有方法依赖昂贵的情感标注或优化间接目标，导致生成语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: 提出RLAIF-SPA框架，使用强化学习从AI反馈机制，通过ASR评估语义准确性，LLM评估韵律-情感标签对齐，在结构、情感、速度和音调四个维度上优化表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，RLAIF-SPA相比Chat-TTS在WER上降低26.1%，SIM-O提高9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效提升了TTS系统的情感表达能力和语音质量，在语义准确性和情感自然度方面均有显著改善。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，然后基于伪标签进行多标签分类来实现聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，且需要预先知道聚类数量的限制。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于同一聚类的文本共享更多标签的假设，通过嵌入编码实现聚类。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法达到或优于现有基线方法，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在不同模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序任务中的表现，发现SFT在权重更新方面优于CL，从而在LLM重排序中具有一致优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，而LLM使用监督微调更有效，这种差异引发了关于哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的问题。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过探测实验比较CL和SFT在通用多模态检索任务中的表现，并进行大规模训练验证。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显胜者，SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，并在MRB基准上达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中优于CL，主要归因于其更强的权重更新机制，这一发现有助于该领域的未来研究和应用。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

*Xinyue Ma,Pol Pastells,Mireia Farrús,Mariona Taulé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种教机器翻译模型理解语义韵律的方法，特别关注中文"被"字句的负面语义韵律，通过构建数据集并微调多个MT模型，显著提升了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵律是语言单位与一系列固定搭配形成的共现意义，与语义意义不同。由于直译对应的词语可能具有不同的语义韵律，需要更多关注这一语言特性以生成准确翻译，但当前机器翻译模型无法处理这一问题。

Method: 聚焦中文"被"字句，创建英汉句子对数据集以展示"被"字句的负面语义韵律，然后对OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行微调，用于英汉翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的MT模型在翻译不利内容时更好地使用"被"字句，在中性和有利内容时避免使用。在NLLB-600M多语言模型中，语义韵律知识可以从英汉翻译转移到其他语言对，如西班牙语-中文。

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集和微调，可以有效教机器翻译模型理解特定结构的语义韵律，提升翻译准确性，且这种知识在多语言模型中具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个包含6种英语方言的大规模基准测试，发现当前多模态生成模型在方言输入下性能下降32.26%-48.17%，并提出了一种编码器缓解策略，能在保持标准英语性能的同时显著提升方言生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究方言使用者与生成模型交互时的表现，因为当前多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入方面的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建包含4200多个方言提示的大规模基准测试，评估17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计了一种基于编码器的缓解策略来提升方言识别能力。

Result: 现有模型在方言输入下性能显著下降32.26%-48.17%，传统缓解方法效果有限(<7%)且会损害标准英语性能。提出的编码器方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当(+34.4%)，同时几乎不影响标准英语表现。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入方面存在严重缺陷，但通过专门的编码器设计可以有效解决这一问题，实现方言与标准英语的平衡性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问等风险，而现有的自动风险检测方法可能减少人类对危害产生方式和受影响人群的理解。

Method: 开发了一个人类中心框架，通过生成用户故事和支持多智能体讨论，帮助人们在部署前思考AI的潜在影响。

Result: 用户研究中，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；未阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事讲述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和利益，并更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中，仅基于最终答案正确性的强化学习会导致虚假推理，需要过程级别的监督来提高推理的可靠性。

Method: 提出可扩展的自聚合方法，从成功轨迹中提取一致的推理检查点，自动构建问题特定的评分标准，无需人工标注或更强的教师模型。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高了推理的忠实性。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过整合基于评分标准的奖励和结果奖励，有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，提升了推理质量。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功耗等综合指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM生成设计的效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个设计问题，每个问题配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成Verilog代码的功能正确性和综合效率。

Result: 最先进LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%的pass@1，但在综合效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%（eff@1），明显落后于专家实现。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件领域LLM研究的进展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含逆向工程提示、创作推理过程和最终文本的三元组结构。通过实验研究创意写作的两组件模型：叙事逻辑和语言表达。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：1）过程监督有效但需要通用数据稳定，创意与通用样本比例至少1:12；2）创意能力具有文化特异性，中英文性能差距达89.26个百分点；3）词汇多样性与创意质量负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑支架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和最终答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要一种与提取规则无关的方法来获得更可靠的模型评估结果。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，在原有输入输出前加上"Answer:"提示，然后从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中展现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Answer Regeneration框架能够为模型评估提供更可靠的结果，减少答案提取算法带来的偏差。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Motivation: MoE模型在部署时由于分布偏移导致路由决策不理想，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，限制了在MoE架构中的实用性

Method: 提出两阶段循环框架：在预填充阶段和定期间隔时，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；然后正常生成文本，保持修改后的路由器直到下一次适应。通过轻量级加法向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上获得一致性能提升，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性。例如在OLMoE上HumanEval提升5.5%，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需数据、在线的测试时适应框架，能够有效改进MoE模型的路由决策，且具有即插即用特性，可与现有测试时缩放技术互补

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

*Emmy Liu,Graham Neubig,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究语言模型训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现在数学和代码领域，中期训练能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，优于持续预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管许多语言模型在预训练结束时采用"中期训练"阶段混入高质量指令数据，但这一实践的科学原理和有效性原因尚不明确。

Method: 通过从头预训练语言模型并在不同领域进行监督微调的对照实验，研究中期训练的效果，并对中期训练开始时间和数据混合权重进行消融研究。

Result: 在数学和代码领域，中期训练在领域内验证损失和预训练数据遗忘方面均优于持续预训练，且训练时机比混合权重影响更大。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR构建的编译器堆栈，专门针对AMD NPU等空间架构，通过AIR方言提供异步和层次化操作的表示，实现空间调度和计算通信重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时，无法充分利用现代空间架构的性能潜力，需要显式机制来协调计算和数据。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言来表示异步和层次化操作，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；多头注意力仅需约150行代码即可实现融合实现。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为高效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理调度实现异步执行和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失和改进嵌入、以及新颖的逐层模型合并方法，显著提升RAG系统中LLM输出一致性的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统依赖LLM生成基于检索上下文的可靠响应，但LLM对语义等价输入常产生不一致输出，现有训练数据稀缺且微调技术在提升一致性方面存在局限。

Method: 采用系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的逐层模型合并方法，整合专业知识模型。

Result: 合并模型显著提升输出一致性，响应相似度相比基线提高约47.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了训练计算量与上下文利用之间的相互作用，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了机器学习模型在心理健康筛查中的有效性，使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，在抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD诊断中达到超过80%的准确率，其中PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率，98%召回率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球主要致残原因，但在初级保健环境中，超过60%的抑郁症或焦虑症病例被误诊，急需可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具来支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，评估了多种模型类别，包括GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调的RoBERTa模型。

Result: 模型在所有诊断类别中达到超过80%的准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率，98%召回率）。使用较短的、聚焦的上下文片段能提高召回率，LoRA微调在低秩配置下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具有显著改进，为在资源匮乏或高污名环境中整合机器学习到临床工作流程奠定了基础，提供了低门槛AI驱动早期诊断的路径。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法需要LLM使用两个独立提示模板顺序生成解决方案和自我验证，效率低下。

Method: 理论推导显示RL目标闭式解可简化为最后token自奖励分数，提出LaSeR算法在原始RLVR损失基础上增加MSE损失来对齐自奖励分数与验证器奖励。

Result: 实验表明方法不仅提升推理性能，还赋予模型显著的自奖励能力，增强推理时扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过最小额外成本实现了推理和自我验证能力的有效联合优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力，能够在较弱教师模型的情况下实现优越性能。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TokDrift框架，通过语义保持的重写规则创建代码变体，发现即使微小的格式变化也会导致代码大语言模型行为发生显著变化，揭示了子词分词与语法标记边界不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码大语言模型使用基于统计的子词分词器（如BPE），而非基于语法的分词，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因空格或标识符命名等表面因素而被不同地分词，影响模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则生成仅在分词上不同的代码变体，并在9个代码大语言模型（包括超过300亿参数的模型）上进行测试，进行分层分析。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为发生显著变化，分层分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕获语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 不匹配的分词是代码理解和生成可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来的代码大语言模型需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache是一种无需训练、架构无关的策略，通过自适应地决定何时刷新（基于最受关注token的注意力感知漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（基于深度感知的调度），减少扩散大语言模型中KV缓存的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远处的MASK token主要作为长度偏置，可以在活动预测窗口之外进行块级缓存；(2) KV动态性随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新即可；(3) 最受关注的token具有最小的KV漂移。提出Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定刷新时机和刷新位置。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现显著加速：GSM8K上8.7倍，长序列上45.1倍，HumanEval上4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。在GSM8K上实现6.8倍吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，有效减少冗余计算，显著加速扩散LLM的解码过程，同时保持生成质量，为扩散LLM的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

TL;DR: PoissonNet是一种新颖的神经网络架构，通过泊松方程作为特征传播机制，解决了现有网格学习方法在高频特征学习、感受野不足、离散化敏感性和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网格学习架构在学习高频特征、感受野不足、对离散化敏感和计算效率方面存在权衡问题，需要一种能够克服这些缺陷的新方法。

Method: 提出局部-全局学习框架，在网格梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解泊松系统以全局传播标量特征更新。

Result: 在语义分割和参数化高细节动画表面等实验中，相比之前的固有架构，PoissonNet达到了最先进的性能，特别是在学习变形方面显著优于现有表面学习方法。

Conclusion: PoissonNet通过泊松方程驱动的局部-全局学习方案，提供了一种高效、可扩展且对网格三角化不敏感的网格学习方法，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分。模型有效性对决策过程至关重要，需要更灵活的有效性验证方法。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型与高保真模型的决策一致性来确定有效性区域，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间，提高计算效率。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持模型有效性的发现。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造复杂机器，这既是人类智能的标志也是工程实践的基础。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持基于部件的构建、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估。对最先进的LLM进行基准测试，并探索强化学习微调。

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、策略性组装和指令遵循等关键能力上表现不足，强化学习微调显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 机器设计任务揭示了LLM在语言、机器设计和物理推理交叉领域面临的挑战，强化学习是提升能力的可行路径。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在因果推理任务中容易产生因果幻觉，即使在没有足够证据支持的情况下也会错误地推断因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在检验大型语言模型是否会在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中产生因果幻觉，这种认知偏差被认为是许多社会问题的基础。

Method: 构建了1000个医学背景下的零列联情景数据集，在这些情景中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后提示LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对其在需要准确因果推理的领域中的应用提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero提出了一种基于动作中心图表示的学习框架，用于指导部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）的规划。该方法通过图神经网络从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，并将学到的启发式方法应用于更大规模问题的蒙特卡洛树搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要特定领域的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在通过统一的基于图的信念表示实现跨问题规模的泛化。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器架构从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后将学到的启发式方法用于指导蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能够零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了POMDP规划的可扩展性和泛化能力，为大规模部分可观测环境下的决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前沿AI模型监管方案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保安全又不阻碍创新的替代监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型开放模拟模型，这些模型采用类似训练方式并从大型专有模型蒸馏而来，作为公共代理供广泛参与安全验证和可解释性研究。

Conclusion: 该政策成本最小但贡献巨大，体现了更深层模型理解能缓解安全与创新权衡的原则，让我们同时获得更多安全与创新。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏可证明公平性保证的结构，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时提供可验证的公平性。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、令牌级的马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应一个代理的偏好。基于代理策略（如个性化语言模型）推导令牌级奖励。提出两种社会选择理论方法：保证事前核心稳定性的随机生成策略，以及使用搜索算法最大化平等主义福利的单一声明生成方法。

Result: 实验显示，使用语言模型实例化代理策略时，基于平等主义目标的搜索生成的共识声明在代理对齐的最坏情况下优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了可证明的公平性保证，通过社会选择理论原则实现了更好的代理对齐和公平性。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统中空间-时间依赖关系利用不足、缺乏严格安全保证和系统复杂性等关键挑战。

Method: 结合GCN-Transformer融合架构的空间-时间图表示学习框架，以及集成控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上，STEMS实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，仅0.13的不适比例保持最佳舒适度。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强大鲁棒性，在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI代理系统提供了统一的语义基础，能够进行形式化验证、检测协调边缘情况、预防死锁和安全漏洞。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

<details>

Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 改进PerceiverIO架构，采用简化编码器(64D潜在空间)防止小数据集过拟合，使用自适应Barlow Twins损失鼓励模态互补性

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比传感器单独使用(61.5%)和图像单独使用(46.2%)表现更好

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在使用RL驱动NPC时面临的常见挑战，并探索RL与行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在Unreal Engine中训练RL代理，创建受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中的多任务NPC，展示了RL模型与行为树联合训练的详细方法。

Result: 证明了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，成功训练了具备多种技能的多任务NPC。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，通过联合嵌入直接和上下文对话来实时触发临床订单检索，无需LLM重写，提供快速、可解释的检索层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了明确指令和隐含推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定和不透明问题，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化，使用重复安全对比目标微调的双编码器，在查询自由模式下编码滚动对话窗口来触发检索，通过受限LLM指导训练连接签名订单与互补表述。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和近期开放嵌入器，查询自由模式对噪声具有弹性，减少对不流畅和ASR错误的敏感性。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将上下文对话链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数设计高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。传统的手动设计奖励函数方法效率低下且难以扩展。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器；为每个自动机状态关联语言嵌入以实现跨任务泛化；在多样化环境中进行实证验证。

Result: 在多个挑战性环境中证明了ARM-FM的有效性，包括展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器形式化方法，为强化学习的自动化奖励设计提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了奖励函数设计的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了在线骚扰代理基准，包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱方法和混合评估框架。研究发现越狱调优使骚扰成功率显著提高，闭源和开源模型表现出不同的升级轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮交互中，需要开发更全面的安全评估方法。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（针对记忆、规划和微调）以及混合评估框架的基准。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash两个模型进行实验。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰成功率从57.25-64.19%提升到95.78-96.89%（Llama），从98.46%提升到99.33%（Gemini），拒绝率降至1-2%。侮辱行为从44.2-50.8%增至84.9-87.8%，攻击行为从31.5-38.8%增至81.2-85.1%。闭源模型显示出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，需要开发强大的安全防护措施来确保在线平台的安全和负责任。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic Self-Learning (ASL)框架，通过生成式奖励模型和多角色协同进化实现无需人工标注数据的智能体自我学习，在搜索代理任务中表现出稳定的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据或预定义规则奖励的情况下，实现基于LLM的智能体的规模化训练，探索开放领域智能体学习的关键因素。

Method: 提出ASL框架，包含提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型，在多角色强化学习环境中形成任务生成、策略执行和评估的闭环系统。

Result: ASL在搜索任务中实现稳定提升，超越传统RLVR基线，在零标注数据条件下持续改进，显示出色的样本效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化能够实现可扩展的自我改进智能体。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试范围有限，缺乏根据模型推理能力进化而调整难度的灵活性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 从现有基准和奥林匹克竞赛中收集复杂推理问题，利用模型推理过程中的关键陈述自适应修改分析挑战，使用仿真软件生成可动态调整难度的问题。

Conclusion: MorphoBench增强了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为提升大模型推理能力和科学稳健性提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个在微调过程中保护大语言模型安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间来防止安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐，即使在良性数据上微调也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预处理的奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关部分，并构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的安全输出。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的实验表明，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，将平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，同时准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace框架能有效保护微调过程中的安全对齐，在保持安全性的同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统虽然能自动化用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意攻击和数据窃取，需要系统化研究这些安全问题。

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的测试平台，识别关键攻击向量如错位、恶意智能体、通信妥协和数据中毒。

Result: 实现了三个协作多智能体场景和四种代表性攻击，展示了框架的灵活性，为快速原型设计、评估和防御迭代提供工具。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过系统化研究安全、隐私和安全性问题。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题时容易受到级联错误的影响，单个错误步骤可能在整个系统中传播并破坏任务轨迹。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：1）下一执行重建，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入来捕捉因果一致性；2）原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重建和异常评分。检测到异常时触发纠正智能体。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同多智能体框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，提高多智能体系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: AI4Service范式将AI从被动工具转变为主动伴侣，Alpha-Service框架为构建真正智能和有用的助手提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态LLM的数学推理能力落后于纯文本LLM，希望探索能否不经过调优直接从现成数学LLM吸收推理能力。

Method: IP-Merging方法：识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数，将其投影到MLLM子空间，然后在该子空间合并参数。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能有效提升MLLM的数学推理能力，且不损害其他能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，能成功将数学推理能力从数学LLM迁移到MLLM。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构：高层推理模型和低层动作模型联合优化。将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并提出前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，缓解长时任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准上达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于提示式(17.7%)、监督学习(54.5%)和强化学习(71.9%)方法。在ScreenSpot-v2基准上表现出竞争力的零样本泛化能力，在AndroidWorld基准上也能有效扩展。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，展示了在复杂场景下的强适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂推理和规划中的挑战，以及多智能体系统存在的高推理成本、长延迟和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: IMAGINE框架通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，使用基础模型Qwen3-8B-Instruct进行训练。

Result: 训练后的单一小规模模型在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的结构化推理和规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了性能并降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能用于直接由动作设置的谓词，而不能用于由公理派生的谓词。但文献中经常偏离这一限制，只要求公理集是可分层的。本文旨在证明这两种变体实际上可以表达相同的查询。

Result: 证明了PDDL标准限制的变体和文献中使用的可分层的变体都可以精确表达与最小不动点逻辑相同的查询，表明派生谓词的负出现可以被消除。

Conclusion: 派生谓词的负出现在PDDL公理中实际上不是必要的限制，因为可以通过转换方法消除，而不会影响表达能力。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

TL;DR: Helmsman是一个多智能体系统，能够根据高层用户规范自动合成端到端的联邦学习系统，通过模拟研发工作流程实现自动化联邦学习系统设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在去中心化数据上训练模型具有强大潜力，但设计和部署稳健系统的复杂性阻碍了其发展。选择、组合和调整策略以应对数据异构性和系统约束等多方面挑战已成为关键瓶颈。

Method: Helmsman通过三个协作阶段模拟原则性研发工作流程：1）交互式人机协同规划制定研究计划；2）监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成；3）在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法生成的解决方案与现有手工构建的基线方法具有竞争力，且通常更优。还引入了AgentFL-Bench基准，包含16个多样化任务来评估智能体系统在联邦学习中的系统级生成能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

TL;DR: JSPLIT是一个基于分类学的框架，通过层次化组织MCP工具并基于用户提示选择最相关工具，有效解决提示膨胀问题，降低提示令牌成本并提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望超越简单文本交互，需要LLM与外部工具交互。但工具数量增加导致提示膨胀，带来高令牌成本、延迟增加和工具选择不准确的问题。

Method: JSPLIT将工具组织成层次化分类学结构，使用用户提示基于查询和分类学结构识别并仅包含最相关工具，减少提示大小。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少提示大小而不显著影响代理响应能力。当可用工具数量大幅增加时，JSPLIT甚至能提高工具选择准确性，在高复杂度代理环境中降低成本的同时提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效解决了MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，通过分类学驱动的工具选择机制，在保持代理性能的同时显著降低了成本，特别适用于高复杂度的代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Motivation: 神经符号AI模型在概念未直接监督时容易出现推理捷径，这会损害模型解释性、分布外性能及可靠性。现有文献分散，需要统一视角来帮助研究者理解和解决这一问题。

Method: 通过温和介绍推理捷径，直观讨论其成因和后果，回顾现有理论特征，详细阐述包括缓解和意识策略在内的应对方法，并分析其优缺点。

Conclusion: 通过重新表述高级材料使其易于理解，本综述为推理捷径提供了统一视角，有望促进可靠神经符号AI和可信AI模型的发展。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Motivation: 研究LLM代理能否从智能问题解决工具发展为能够自主规划、设计任务并推理模糊目标的独立实体。

Method: 在开放环境中增强预训练LLM代理，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并与环境广泛交互，然后进行定性研究。

Result: 代理能够可靠执行复杂多步骤指令、跨运行存储和重用信息、提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感、容易重复生成任务、无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究显示了将预训练LLM适应开放性的前景和当前局限，指出了未来在记忆管理、高效探索和追求抽象长期目标方面的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Conclusion: ColorBench框架能够有效评估移动智能体在复杂长任务中的表现，支持多有效解决方案验证和细粒度能力分析，为移动智能体的发展提供了重要的评估工具和改进方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和知识漂移问题。该框架包含三个维度：地图与领土（表征与现实）、直觉与理性（快速与慢速思维）、冲突与确认（批判性测试与相互验证），旨在使AI模型的局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)虽然输出流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险——听起来令人信服但缺乏事实有效性。LLMs在规模化地操作系统1认知：快速、联想且具有说服力，但缺乏反思或证伪。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：(i)地图与领土：区分现实表征(认识论)与现实本身(本体论)；(ii)直觉与理性：基于双过程理论分离快速情感判断与慢速反思思维；(iii)冲突与确认：检验想法是通过分歧进行批判性测试还是仅通过相互验证得到强化。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图通过更多数据或规则来修复LLMs，而是提供一个反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工智能的直觉，都必须受人类理性的支配。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，我们才能使机器流畅性与人类理解保持一致。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估当前研究中对算法偏见的处理情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表的元素，应用于35篇同行评审研究进行系统文献回顾。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据处理记录良好，但大多数研究省略了明确的公平性框架、亚组分析和对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性导向框架，为公共卫生ML从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进健康公平而非损害它。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能生成语法有效、语义连贯的可执行推理路径。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到结构化知识图谱推理的连接，支持确定性执行和证据检索。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Conclusion: NAEL为人工智能伦理提供了一个非人类中心主义的新框架，能够产生适应性强、情境敏感的伦理行为。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Conclusion: 本文成功将基于效用的算法配置方法提升到实用水平，展示了在算法选择问题中探索解决方案对效用函数变化的鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构上均能有效提升性能

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量中的冗余信息，显著改善模型合并性能

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和序列移动模式的理解，且工业级POI推荐需要整合世界知识和人类认知对齐（如季节、天气、假期、用户画像等）来提升用户体验和推荐性能。

Method: CoAST框架包含两个阶段：(1) 推荐知识获取：在脱敏用户的丰富时空轨迹数据上继续预训练；(2) 认知对齐：通过监督微调和强化学习阶段，使用丰富训练数据将认知判断与人类偏好对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛离线实验和部署在AMAP App首页"猜你想去"的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST通过整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和个人信息，成功解决了大语言模型在POI推荐任务中的局限性，并在实际应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

### [266] [SimKO: Simple Pass@K Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14807)
*Ruotian Peng,Yi Ren,Zhouliang Yu,Weiyang Liu,Yandong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLVR方法中存在的系统性偏差问题，提出了SimKO方法来缓解概率过度集中现象，从而提高探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K（K>1）下降。需要理解并解决这种概率过度集中问题。

Method: 提出SimKO方法：对于验证正确的响应，提升top-K候选的概率；对于验证错误的响应，对top-1候选施加更强的惩罚。该方法在具有高熵的token上特别有效。

Result: 在多个数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO在各种K值下都能持续产生更高的pass@K性能，有效改善了RLVR的探索能力。

Conclusion: SimKO通过不对称设计有效缓解了RLVR中的概率过度集中问题，为改进强化学习与可验证奖励方法的探索能力提供了简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

*Dominik Jehle,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环选择性请求必要信息，大幅减少NL2SQL任务中的token使用量（最多87%），同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token数量多和处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理系统设计，使用交互式循环和推理框架，让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务，而不是一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上的评估显示，token使用量最多减少87%，成本大幅降低，同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过选择性信息请求机制，有效解决了NL2SQL任务中元信息过多导致的成本问题，实现了效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RoboGPT-R1，一个用于具身规划的两阶段微调框架，通过监督训练获取基础知识，再通过强化学习提升视觉空间理解和推理能力，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在规划任务中取得成功，但在复杂现实环境中执行长视野操作任务时仍面临挑战，主要由于常识和推理能力受限。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练通过专家序列获取基础知识，然后使用强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足，设计了考虑长视野性能和动作约束的基于规则的奖励函数。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练得到的推理模型，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini 21.33%，并超过其他在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架有效提升了具身代理的推理能力，特别是在物理理解和动作序列一致性方面，为复杂长视野操作任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

### [269] [Boosting Instruction Following at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14842)
*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过提高LLM对提示指令的遵循率来增强可靠性，在包含2-10条指令的情况下可将指令遵循率提升4-7个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过精心设计提示词来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令并不能保证它们会被实际遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，该基准包含最多10条指令的数据样本。还开发了定量冲突评分工具来分析指令间的冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting可将指令遵循率提升高达7个百分点（2条指令时）和4个百分点（10条指令时）。分析发现性能下降与指令间冲突程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting能有效提高LLM对提示指令的遵循可靠性，冲突评分工具可为开发者提供关于额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现中取得进展，但搜索效果依赖于如何将领域先验编码为操作结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，通过安全包络约束智能体；使用单次延续参数加权所有可达路径，求和得到覆盖生成函数；提供几何解释和可测试推断。

Result: 提出了一个可操作的语言和工具来衡量智能体及其搜索空间，通过多数投票实例验证了理论推断。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述框架，能够有效衡量搜索过程和智能体性能。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

### [272] [The Gatekeeper Knows Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14881)
*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper协议来解决LLM作为自主代理时的上下文窗口限制和状态不同步问题，通过潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文来提高代理可靠性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时面临上下文窗口有限、状态不同步等限制，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper协议框架，让代理先在低保真潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需请求高保真上下文，所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行状态同步。

Result: 该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper协议为构建更稳健、可预测和接地气的AI代理提供了基础方法，适用于任何结构化知识领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的智能体，能够在无需标注样本或模型权重更新的情况下自我改进，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，显著提高企业智能平台中第三方日志的模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要整合来自多个第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配、格式混乱或不完整，这使得模式映射变得困难。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体：1）识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2）生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3）应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。使用GPT-4o进行100次迭代。

Result: 映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%；同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射数量减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种基于证据的透明方法来解决未来行业问题，为更鲁棒、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、自适应和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Motivation: 现有生成式验证器虽然性能优秀但计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。需要寻找更高效的验证策略。

Method: 采用判别式验证器结合自一致性的混合方法，在固定计算预算下进行测试时扩展。

Result: 在固定计算预算下，该混合方法比最先进的生成式验证准确率高出15.3%（AIME2025数据集）。

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证不仅是对自一致性的'免费'升级，而且是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础，证明了多模态方法和预训练嵌入的有效性。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论相结合，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过自信问题提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: H-Risk能预测过自信错误；LLMs中脆弱的内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关；批判式提示对校准和幻觉的影响不一。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树引导和保真度感知的自动过程监督框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，在少量自动标注数据上实现高质量的多步推理监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)面临三大挑战：奖励噪声大、事实保真度低、与步骤级推理目标不对齐。这些问题的根源在于缺乏可扩展的高质量标注，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估，或仅从最终结果推断步骤质量的蒙特卡洛估计方法。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2) 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供执行基础的正确性信号；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为理由增强的生成结构，提高可解释性。

Result: 仅使用4万自动标注样本(最佳自动监督PRM数据量的10%)，在ProcessBench上实现高达26%的相对性能提升。用于奖励引导的贪婪搜索时，甚至优于使用人工标注监督训练的PRMs。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM提供了一个可扩展且可验证的路径，能够实现高质量的过程级推理监督，解决了现有PRMs的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成的虚假内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型的虚假内容，而现实场景中虚假内容类型通常是未知的，限制了现有系统的有效性。

Method: 构建了OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，增强类别感知的MoE适配器来捕捉类别特定线索，并采用归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能表现，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.
