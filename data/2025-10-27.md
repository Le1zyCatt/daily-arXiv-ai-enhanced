### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练时建立干扰因素的快捷通道，避免目标属性与干扰因素纠缠，提升生成质量和文本提示遵循能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器训练方法容易将目标属性与姿势、表情、光照等干扰因素纠缠，限制了模型的泛化能力和文本提示遵循能力

Method: 在适配器训练时，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为干扰因素建立快捷通道，消除适配器学习这些因素的动机，推理时移除辅助模块

Result: 在人脸和全身身份注入任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和文本提示遵循能力

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效途径可能是为不应学习的内容建立快捷通道

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [ArtiLatent: Realistic Articulated 3D Object Generation via Structured Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21432)
*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，通过联合建模部件几何和关节动力学，在统一潜空间中合成具有精细几何、准确关节和逼真外观的3D物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理3D物体的几何一致性、关节准确性和外观逼真度，特别是在不同关节配置下保持视觉真实感。

Method: 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜空间，然后训练潜扩散模型进行多样化采样，并引入关节感知高斯解码器来重建逼真3D形状。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节化3D物体合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够生成物理上合理的多样化样本。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [3] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，在开源方法中达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: VAP 将问题重新定义为上下文生成，使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的混合变换器专家引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，采用时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP 在开源方法中达到了新的最先进水平，获得了38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP 的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [4] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Group Inertial Poser方法，通过融合IMU和UWB距离测量来精确估计多人全身运动和全局轨迹，解决了纯IMU方法在平移估计和相对定位方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯IMU方法存在平移估计不准确和个体间相对定位困难的问题，因为惯性测量本质上是自参考的，无法提供他人的直接空间参考。

Method: 利用稀疏可穿戴传感器之间的距离（包括个体内部和个体之间），通过超宽带测距估计绝对距离，并与惯性观测融合输入结构化状态空间模型，结合两步优化来跟踪全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据评估中，Group Inertial Poser在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法，并发布了首个IMU+UWB双人跟踪数据集GIP-DB。

Conclusion: IMU+UWB融合方法在野外多人运动捕捉中展现出巨大潜力，能够实现精确的3D姿态估计和全局轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [5] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕获全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多样化尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度表示的高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最先进方法，证实了其有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效解决了医学图像分割中的全局上下文捕获和边界精度问题，在多种医学成像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [6] [WorldGrow: Generating Infinite 3D World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21682)
*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于生成无限扩展的3D场景，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现几何一致且外观逼真的大规模环境合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在关键挑战：2D提升方法在视图间存在几何和外观不一致，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型主要面向对象而非场景级生成。

Method: 采用三个核心组件：(1)高质量场景块数据提取流水线；(2)支持上下文感知场景扩展的3D块修复机制；(3)确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度的由粗到细生成策略。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

### [7] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配方法建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡情况下提供更准确的点轨迹估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式模型在点跟踪中只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉轨迹的多模态特性，特别是在视觉遮挡和外观变化导致的模糊情况下。

Method: 使用流匹配公式训练生成模型，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性的窗口相关先验，以及专门为点坐标调整的方差调度。推理时采用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现出色，特别是在遮挡点跟踪方面达到最先进水平，同时保持可见点跟踪的竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪精度，为不确定环境下的点跟踪提供了生成式解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [8] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这与临床医生的诊断工作流程不符，限制了可信赖的临床AI协作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包含：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估基准，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，为定位和诊断准确性提供基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的局部决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法依赖光照和材质特性，限制了在透明、半透明和异质物体上的应用。热偏振成像能够克服这些限制，提供更可靠的形状重建。

Method: 基于偏振观测的一般理论，利用多视角热偏振图像进行3D形状重建，通过长波红外偏振成像避免可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材质的新途径，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的对象中心自监督适应方法，用于视觉基础模型在无标注情况下的领域适应，通过多视角对象视频实现模型性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域性能下降的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而生成语言模型的自监督学习策略在视觉编码器模型中效果不佳。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用短多视角对象中心视频进行自监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术以防止知识遗忘。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA通过多视角对象观察有效学习对变化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可提升视觉基础模型在目标领域的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化即插即用流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在工业环境中的复杂条件下（如杂乱、光照差、复杂背景）性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的基础模型引导的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的误报。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在工业环境中提升未见物体检测的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，需要自动化方法来检测混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋作为损伤指标。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，使用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，通过微调、数据增强和公开数据集测试，建立自动分类框架识别建筑内外和结构构件。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过深度学习方法和图像处理技术，可以实现地震后结构损伤的快速自动化评估，为灾后应急响应提供有效工具。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型进行开放词汇识别，生成丰富的语义场景表示，支持增量更新和3D几何定位，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角设置，不支持增量更新，缺乏3D空间的显式几何定位，而这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其定位到3D空间。节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕捉空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何定位，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的语义分割解码器架构，通过在空间域和小波域联合优化特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在保持语义完整性的同时增强高频结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割网络过于依赖强大的预训练编码器，而解码器设计过于简单，导致语义上下文与细粒度细节保存之间的权衡不理想。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器：1）从小波域学习高频分量作为显式先验强化边界细节；2）双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）频谱分解注意力（SDA）块利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模增强高频结构细节；4）重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验与基于Mamba的注意力机制，在语义分割任务中取得了优异的性能表现，有效平衡了语义上下文与细节保存。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合专家文本概念和视觉特征的多模态学习框架，用于先天性巨结肠症肠神经丛分类，通过对比语言-图像预训练模型结合医学专业知识，在分类性能上超越了传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式。需要开发能够整合临床专业知识、提供更符合医学实践的可解释模型。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)为基础的视觉-语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（医学教科书和论文），通过大型语言模型生成提示词，经团队审核后使用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 所提模型在各项分类指标上均优于CNN模型（VGG-19、ResNet-18、ResNet-50），准确率达到83.9%，精确度86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有巨大潜力，整合专家知识能够产生更具临床相关性的模型输出，为医学图像分析提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型(HistRetinex)，用于快速低光照图像增强，通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，显著提高了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Retinex低光照图像增强方法在大尺寸图像上处理时间过长，需要一种更高效的增强方法。

Method: 定义了直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立了光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系，构建了两级优化模型，通过求解优化模型得到光照和反射率直方图的迭代公式，最后通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上均优于现有增强方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex是一种高效的低光照图像增强方法，在保持增强质量的同时显著提高了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，要求智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并进行动态决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要在静态、完全可观察的环境中进行视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或视野限制而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取信息的推理系统。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，提供丰富的思维链标注。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中训练智能体进行不确定性识别、信息增益预测和动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA、RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath、Geometry30K)任务上达到最先进性能。分析表明当前具身MLLM虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是解决现实世界信息不完整性的关键能力，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体通过交互主动获取和整合信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向对象、考虑不确定性的城市规模LiDAR变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐，结合语义分割和二分图匹配处理对象分裂合并，在保持内存效率的同时实现高精度变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度敏感，缺乏对象身份识别，内存需求大且无法处理对象分裂合并情况，需要一种更稳健的城市规模LiDAR变化检测方案。

Method: 使用多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP进行时序对齐，通过注册协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测水平，结合语义分割和类约束二分图分配处理对象关联，采用分块处理控制内存。

Result: 在15个Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，优于Triplet KPConv方法，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对象中心化和不确定性感知的流程，有效解决了城市规模LiDAR变化检测中的对齐、内存和对象关联问题，实现了稳健的性能提升。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

<details>

Motivation: 大规模基础模型为下游分割任务提供强大特征表示，但全参数微调计算开销大。现有方法嵌入可训练提示但缺乏语义先验，限制了模型适应性。

Method: 构建轻量级动态混合局部先验提取器，通过异构卷积捕获多样局部先验，使用门控网络动态输出专家先验；设计双向交互适配器，采用余弦对齐可变形注意力和通道自适应尺度增强进行特征交互重构。

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态先验调制实现了参数高效的微调，在分割任务中展现出卓越性能和多任务适应性。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标注粗糙模糊，无法区分导致安全问题的具体特征。需要系统方法识别图像中细微但关键的差异如何影响安全性。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型生成反事实图像对，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签但保持其他细节不变。

Result: 构建了包含3020对图像的安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别。该基准能有效暴露视觉语言模型在区分细微图像差异时的弱点，并作为数据增强策略提升轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全差异的资源，为理解和改进图像安全评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO是一个多模态强化学习框架，通过向视觉输入注入可控噪声来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架建模优势估计，从而提升多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习框架在提升通用链式思维推理能力时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一个能够增强探索性和鲁棒性的多模态强化学习方法。

Method: 提出NoisyGRPO框架，包含两个关键组件：(1) 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声，鼓励在更广泛的视觉场景中进行探索；(2) 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励信息来计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Result: 在标准链式思维质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化性和鲁棒性，特别是在使用小规模多模态大语言模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的强化学习设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的噪声注入和贝叶斯优势估计，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理泛化能力，为小规模模型的强化学习训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Motivation: CTPA依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。本研究旨在开发一种从NCCT生成DCCTPA的方法，避免对比剂使用。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，在410对CTPA和NCCT扫描数据上进行训练和验证，包括内部验证集249对和测试集161对。

Result: 在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE:156.28，PSNR:20.71，SSIM:0.98；测试集MAE:165.12，PSNR:20.27，SSIM:0.98），血管分割Dice系数达0.70，血管体积ICC为0.81，显著优于NCCT。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成具有血管增强效果的DCCTPA图像，在保持图像保真度和结构完整性的同时，显著改善了血管分割和量化性能，特别是对小血管的增强效果明显。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)框架，通过网格化结构显式编码空间布局和关系，作为文本的补充通道来评估和提升基础模型的空间智能能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉空间智能(VSI)的方法主要依赖文本提示和VQA式评分，这会模糊几何信息、引入语言捷径，并削弱对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入SIG结构化网格模式，构建SIG-informed评估指标，在少样本情境学习中测试多模态LLMs，并发布SIGBench基准数据集。

Result: SIG在所有VSI指标上都比纯VQA表示带来更大、更稳定、更全面的提升，表明其作为数据标注和训练模式的潜力。

Conclusion: SIG为学习VSI提供了有前景的数据标注和训练模式，能够有效分离空间能力与语言先验。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用块状设计，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门的速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块和特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，BFM相比现有Flow Matching方法在保持相似生成性能的同时，实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM框架通过块状设计和语义特征引导，在Flow Matching方法中建立了显著改进的帕累托前沿，平衡了生成质量和推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一文本空间来对齐不同物体和领域的视觉语义，这种不加区分的对齐方式阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 将token-agnostic文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过语义亲和力动态分配每个token到子空间组合，使用最优传输问题建模动态对齐，并通过top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态token-wise对齐机制，有效提升了零样本异常检测的性能，能够更准确地捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过整合多模态知识重构问题并扩展现有问题，实现难度可控的动态评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE能缓解数据污染和饱和风险，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新方法，用于生成高质量的艺术风格3D网格，通过并行生成实现高效控制，支持多达10,000个面，空间分辨率达1024³。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高精度的令牌预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时查看所有网格令牌来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用解耦训练和混合推理，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；改进沙漏架构，使用双向注意力和旋转位置嵌入；引入连接损失作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能生成高质量3D艺术风格网格，支持多达10,000个面，空间分辨率达1024³。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成中实现了高效性和高质量，为艺术风格3D内容创作提供了新方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，通过对象中心语义标注和物理感知执行连接，构建了首个基于3DGS的VLN基准测试。

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，无法满足视觉语言导航的需求。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含对象中心语义标注（为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注）和物理感知执行连接（嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口）。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准测试SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化性强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上基线性能提升31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，为视觉语言导航提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中处理极小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的分割和推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 由于难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集中，视觉-语言对齐的可解释性尚未得到研究。

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，通过距离编码器和两个模态特定解码器构建，鼓励语义相似的表示在自监督训练中表现出一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLM（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能提升零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过统一概念集成功解释和增强了视觉-语言对齐，为多模态表示的可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑3D表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在65,000多个多荧光3D细胞体积数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能预测下游信号活动、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的形态动态转换。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟连接形态、扰动和功能，推动实现3D虚拟细胞。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了复杂环境条件下的识别精度，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合像素级L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估了两种配准策略，发现基于IMPACT的配准能产生更准确的解剖对齐，但训练数据与评估管道一致的Elastix配准在验证集上得分更高，反映了配准偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型，减少配准偏差对性能评估的影响。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练跨解剖区域并针对每个区域进行微调。损失函数结合像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估了Elastix和IMPACT两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的配准，sCT合成效果更好，MAE更低，解剖结构更真实。但在公开验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了配准偏差问题。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的配准来减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用固定步数进行去噪，不考虑下游传输限制。在实际云到设备场景中，有限带宽需要重度压缩，导致纹理丢失和计算浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型以目标质量级别为条件，学习自适应调制去噪过程，使用轻量级质量嵌入指导去噪轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和优化策略，成功解决了图像拼接中的视差问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

TL;DR: 提出了多模态未剪辑视频检索任务和MUVR基准，专注于长视频平台的多模态查询检索，包含53K未剪辑视频和1050个多模态查询，评估了多种检索模型和MLLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索方法主要针对短视频和单模态查询，无法满足长视频平台对多模态细粒度检索的需求，因此需要开发专门针对未剪辑长视频的多模态检索基准。

Method: 构建MUVR基准，支持视频中心的多模态查询（长文本描述、视频标签提示、掩码提示），采用一对多检索范式，基于核心视频内容构建多级视觉对应关系（复制、事件、场景、实例、动作等六个级别）。

Result: 对3种最先进的视频检索模型、6种基于图像的VLM和10种MLLM进行了广泛评估，揭示了检索方法在处理未剪辑视频和多模态查询方面的局限性，以及MLLM在多视频理解和重排序方面的不足。

Conclusion: MUVR基准有效评估了当前方法在长视频多模态检索中的性能，为未来研究提供了重要参考，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应地识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于少数预定义概念轴（如颜色、形状），且主要在合成数据集中探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的视觉概念。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴，通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征，使用组合锚定目标确保各轴独立操作。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方面优于现有方法，为处理真实世界多样化视觉概念提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚，需要研究注意力头如何专门处理特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释用最终解码层探测中间激活的做法，以原则性方式分析多个样本，并根据注意力头与目标概念的相关性进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态变换器中，注意力头层面存在一致的专业化模式，仅编辑1%的注意力头即可可靠地抑制或增强目标概念。

Conclusion: 注意力层内存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图像恢复CNN的查找表实现中的各向异性池化方法，以替代传统的平均池化，从而提高恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性的信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 首先引入广义中值池化方法，然后扩展为学习数据相关的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块能够自适应地加权贡献。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知和数值上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的图像恢复CNN的性能，特别是在处理各向异性结构时表现更优。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模3D对象和场景的层次结构时存在局限：要么需要多次渲染来捕获不同粒度级别的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样和细微结构的泛化能力差。

Method: 使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何特性自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，展示了在3D场景理解方面的卓越效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何成功解决了3D场景层次结构建模的挑战，提供了一种更高效和适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Motivation: 在线视频异常检测因实时约束和计算强度而很少受到关注，而现有的离线VAD方法无法满足实时需求。

Method: 使用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来建模时间依赖，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储近期分数。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且与弱监督方法竞争性相当，无需训练。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够实时识别异常行为。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，往往忽视时空稳定性，对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块编码一致性先验并注入I2V生成主干网络。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中取得竞争性表现，显著改善前景对齐和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦方法和间隔帧先验有效解决了视频修复中的时空稳定性问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中的黑盒问题，为临床医生提供透明、可验证的解释，以增强对自动化诊断的信任并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式，发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: 在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确性，每个预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式，并提供可验证的激活图库。

Conclusion: 医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中具有关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a

ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GranViT，一种集成细粒度特征提取与语义对齐的新型视觉Transformer，通过区域级自回归训练解决现有视觉编码器缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器主要关注全局图像表示，但忽视了细粒度区域分析，由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和预训练范式，限制了在细粒度感知方面的能力。

Method: 构建了Gran-29M数据集（包含200万张自然和OCR图像，1.8亿个高质量区域级标注），采用预训练-适应框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归和标题到边界框回归来增强视觉表示和定位能力。

Result: GranViT超越了现有视觉编码器，在不同LLMs上表现出强迁移性，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: GranViT通过大规模细粒度预训练和区域级自回归训练，成功提升了视觉编码器的细粒度感知能力，在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Foresight Guidance (FSG)方法，通过将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，解决了现有Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方法在效率和设计空间上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CFG方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择，需要统一的理论框架来改进条件引导机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，寻找潜在空间中的黄金路径，使潜在变量在条件生成和无条件生成下产生一致输出。提出FSG方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并开启了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley音效生成方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型强大性能的同时，通过最小化训练参数实现视频音频的时序对齐。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力。提示词设置全局语义，视频细化时序和局部动态。通过池化视频token减少内存需求并稳定训练。

Result: 在精选的视频音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时序和语义对齐方面表现具有竞争力，训练参数远少于最近的多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频引导Foley音效生成解决方案，虽然专注于视频到Foley，但相同的桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态（如语音）。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，通过将优化范式从步骤级转移到块级，解决了GRPO在文本到图像生成中的优势归因不准确和忽略生成时间动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出强大潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时间动态。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'，捕捉流匹配的内在时间动态，并在块级优化策略。还引入了可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决夜间跟踪的主要技术挑战，在UAVDark135基准测试中显著超越现有方法，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪在真实机器人操作中面临重大挑战，包括低光照条件限制视觉感知能力、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化导致跟踪器漂移或失败。现有基于低光增强和域自适应的方法在实际无人机系统中存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态物体信息等问题。

Method: MATrack通过三个核心模块协同工作：多尺度层次混合(MHB)增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息；夜间模板校准器(NTC)确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精确度、归一化精确度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。在实际无人机平台上的进一步测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，证明了其在真实世界机器人操作中的实用价值。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段文本图像超分辨率框架，通过"文本优先、图像后续"范式，先重建精确文本结构再指导全图像超分辨率，解决了传统方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: 提出TIGER两阶段框架：1）明确将字形恢复与图像增强解耦，先重建精确文本结构；2）使用重建的文本结构指导后续全图像超分辨率。还贡献了UltraZoom-ST数据集，支持极端缩放训练和评估。

Result: 大量实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提升了文本可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过字形到图像的引导机制，成功打破了图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用深度学习模型自动检测MEG记录中的发作间期癫痫样放电，解决了传统手动检测的繁琐和不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物难治性癫痫的术前评估中，MEG检测发作间期癫痫样放电对定位致痫区很重要，但手动检测既繁琐又容易出错，现有自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了两种模型架构：基于特征的人工神经网络(ANN)和卷积神经网络(CNN)，在59名患者数据库上训练，并采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上都优于现有最先进模型(F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44)，交互式机器学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂和不完美标注数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习策略有潜力加速数据标注，提出的模型是自动检测发作间期癫痫样放电的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据受限问题，昂贵的像素级标注导致相关子任务需要分别训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，采用迭代生成框架优先处理困难类别，并提出流线型多掩码解码器处理检测中的固有模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能有效解决显著目标检测中的数据受限问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下的过自信和性能退化问题，在少量数据和计算资源下实现竞争性检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模预训练模型在资源受限、数据质量差场景下的过自信和性能退化问题，特别是针对模糊或弱相关的图像-文本对。

Method: 采用两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入受控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布），共同减少过自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅使用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间即达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在大型潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，影响3D场景的真实感。3D一致视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用具有重要意义。

Method: 使用成对极线几何约束通过基于偏好的优化来对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法不需要端到端可微分性，在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练以确保高质量测量。

Result: 评估表明经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，学习指标会产生噪声目标损害对齐质量。模型能有效泛化到各种动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，在不影响视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Motivation: 不同领域的点云数据训练规模有限，现有方法将不同领域数据混合进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游任务可能不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计了异质域适配器，在预训练阶段使用适应模式学习跨域信息，在微调阶段使用融合模式增强点云特征；同时引入域特征生成器来指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能够有效解决点云数据稀缺问题，通过自适应整合跨域知识，在多个下游任务中实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过动态调整蒸馏过程，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，证明了考虑学生模型学习进程的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and

*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了长尾识别方法在北美相机陷阱图像数据集上的应用，通过实验优化LTR损失函数和正则化方法，显著提升了物种识别准确率，并在领域迁移测试中表现出更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北美相机陷阱图像数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大类别占比超过50%，需要解决长尾分布下的物种识别挑战。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感正则化方法，构建减少偏差的测试集评估领域迁移能力。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%基线有显著提升；在领域迁移测试中达到52.55%的准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强调度器选择与先进LTR损失函数结合在野生动物领域表现一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重领域迁移下尾部类别的灾难性失效问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督的突触分类方法，基于邻近突触比随机突触更相似的观察，无需预先知道突触类型数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统突触分类需要监督学习，需要提供不同类别的示例。本文旨在开发一种仅基于突触相似性的无监督分类方法。

Method: 利用邻近突触比随机突触更相似的原理，在果蝇数据上进行无监督突触分类，无需预先指定类别数量。

Result: 成功应用于果蝇数据，能够分离出不同的突触类型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需先验知识的突触分类方式，并为选择涵盖突触结构范围的真实数据提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型在皮肤病理学全切片图像分类中的表现，使用多种机器学习分类器，发现Virchow2在大多数情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全切片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以提高诊断效率。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略生成切片级特征，然后训练逻辑回归、梯度提升树和随机森林等分类器。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数切片级分类器中表现优于UNI，逻辑回归达到最高准确率90%，但差异无统计学意义。数据增强和图像归一化提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化全切片图像分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为切片级表示学习的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Motivation: 解决生态学中因缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任而阻碍计算机视觉技术应用的问题，通过可解释性方法为预测提供证据并记录现场部署的重要限制。

Method: 使用Glacier Bay国家公园的航空图像训练Faster R-CNN检测海豹，应用梯度类激活映射(HiResCAM、LayerCAM)、局部可解释模型无关解释(LIME)和基于扰动的解释方法生成预测解释。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非周围环境，移除海豹会降低检测置信度；分析揭示了系统性错误源，包括海豹与黑冰和岩石的混淆。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后处理可解释性相结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计的、支持决策的保护监测工具，并为模型开发提供具体改进方向。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

TL;DR: BachVid是一种无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，实现无需参考图像的多视频一致生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖参考图像或大量训练，且通常只解决角色一致性，背景一致性仍需图像到视频模型处理。

Method: 分析DiT注意力机制，发现其能在去噪过程中提取前景掩码和匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid为无需参考图像或额外训练的一致视频生成提供了新颖高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型作为几何求解器的潜力，解决传统上难以处理的几何问题，建立生成建模与几何问题求解之间的桥梁。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型将高斯噪声转换为表示有效近似解的图像，模型学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置。

Result: 模型能够为三个著名几何问题生成接近精确解的有效近似解，证明了在图像空间中操作解决困难几何问题的可行性。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作提供了一个通用实用的框架来近似解决困难几何问题，为处理更广泛挑战性几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法让标准指令微调语言模型无需额外训练就能达到或超越对应推理模型的性能，通过结合代码执行和少量样本的上下文学习实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型虽然成功但需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高且慢。研究发现标准指令模型本身已具备强大推理能力，只需合适激发方法。

Method: CodeAdapt方法：结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在自然语言推理中穿插代码执行）和少量样本的上下文学习（仅需5个训练问题）。

Result: 在4对匹配的语言模型和推理模型对比中，CodeAdapt让3个语言模型在8个任务上平均超越对应推理模型（最高22.9%），同时token效率提升10-81%；在6个任务上4个模型平均性能更优（最高35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性；支持代码的语言模型是认知基础强大的系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 随着语言模型处理长文本能力的增强，在计算文学研究中的应用日益增多，但评估这些模型的有效性面临挑战，包括长文本细粒度标注成本高、公共领域文学数据污染问题，以及现有相似性数据集不适用于文学领域任务。

Method: 收集并发布FICSIM数据集，包含长篇小说文本，基于作者提供的元数据构建12个相似性维度的评分，并由数字人文学者验证。评估了一系列嵌入模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，现有嵌入模型普遍倾向于关注表层特征，而对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别关注不足。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集填补了文学领域评估工具的空白，揭示了当前嵌入模型在文学分析中的局限性，同时强调了在数据收集过程中尊重作者自主权和持续知情同意的重要性。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Motivation: 现有长上下文基准测试大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表真实世界文档理解的复杂性。推翻关系是普通法体系的基础，为长文档法律理解提供了重要测试平台。

Method: 使用236个案件对的数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型识别美国最高法院案件中的推翻关系。

Result: 模型表现出三个关键局限：对历史案件性能下降（时代敏感性）；依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解（浅层推理）；在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系（上下文依赖推理失败）。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了现实长上下文评估的关键空白，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的基准环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

Motivation: 思维链推理虽然能提升复杂任务的准确性，但会增加token使用量，且在某些任务中可能无效甚至有害。需要一种自适应机制来决定何时使用思维链。

Method: 使用四种训练无关的置信度估计方法进行思维链门控，与随机基线和理想情况对比，评估何时应该触发思维链推理。

Conclusion: 置信度门控思维链具有潜力，但当前方法的可靠性有限，需要进一步研究更可靠的自适应门控机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more

*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究量化了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要中幻觉和事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）生成NBA比赛摘要，手动标注了3,312个事实错误。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入减少69%（Llama）和65%（Qwen）错误，行结构输入减少54%（Llama）和51%（Qwen）错误。方差分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入数据结构对LLM生成事实准确性有决定性影响，结构化输入（特别是JSON格式）能显著减少幻觉和事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了在严格低误报率(FPR)机制下，推理增强对分类任务的影响，发现推理虽然能提高整体准确率，但在精度敏感场景下表现不佳，而简单集成两种模式可以发挥各自优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理已成为大语言模型(LLMs)的核心范式，并在各种基准测试中持续提升准确率，但其在精度敏感任务中的适用性仍不明确。

Method: 研究覆盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLMs和大推理模型(LRMs)，比较推理增强(Think On)和无推理(Think Off)两种模式，以及基于token的评分与自我表达置信度方法。

Result: 推理增强生成提高整体准确率，但在低FPR阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分显著优于自我表达置信度；两种模式的简单集成能恢复各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和选择编辑演示来解决上下文知识编辑中的数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性问题，显著提升编辑成功率和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文知识编辑器依赖静态演示集，存在数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性问题，需要更智能的演示选择方法。

Method: 训练BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例，实现动态演示选择。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE提供了一种可扩展且自适应的知识编辑方法，无需修改模型权重，适用于黑盒LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，而印尼语等低资源语言缺乏相应研究的问题。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，包含问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强以克服印尼语数据集有限的挑战。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究显示了在低资源语言中进行问答系统的前景与挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，专注于代谢疾病的出院药物推荐，包含5,894条去标识化记录，并评估了多个大语言模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于电子健康记录(EHRs)的智能药物推荐对提高临床决策质量和效率至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界EHR数据集，特别是非英语数据集，阻碍了此类系统的发展。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条去标识化记录的CDrugRed数据集，涵盖患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多个最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然监督微调提高了模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1得分为0.5648，Jaccard得分为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统提供了一个具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，提升泛化性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)作为离策略方法，在有限数据场景下容易过拟合且泛化能力差，需要解决这些局限性。

Method: 结合SFT和近端策略优化(PPO)，设计以SFT模型与预训练基础模型策略比率为基础的奖励函数，作为隐式奖励信号进行在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景中。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用演示数据对齐大语言模型，解决了SFT的关键限制，提高了泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实性检测基准存在标注模糊问题，主要源于对生成输出中允许使用的外部知识边界定义不清，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中仍有约6%的句子存在幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对不忠实检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色但缺乏结构化推理能力，而文本属性图提供显式关系结构但语义深度不足。两者的结合能够产生互补优势，增强图表示学习并改进LLM的推理和可解释性。

Method: 从编排角度提出了系统性的分类法，包括两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG（LLM丰富基于图的任务）和TAG用于LLM（结构化图改进LLM推理）。将编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效微调方法。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并突出了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: 该调查为语言和图学习交叉领域的未来工作提供了指导，并概述了开放挑战和有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

Method: 通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，从五个语言维度分析LLMs的行为，检验其社会认知偏差。

Result: LLMs未能忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映了过度理想化的版本，表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极性偏差。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础的LLMs，以捕捉人类社会行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Conclusion: 该分类法基础的多智能体系统能够高保真地模拟多样化的临床合理调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估，并为实时决策支持奠定基础。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

Motivation: 传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性而忽视长程结构复杂性，无法解释LLM即使困惑度低时仍出现重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为。

Method: 使用相关维度（一种分形几何的自相似性度量）来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，该方法捕捉语言的分层递归结构。

Result: 相关维度揭示了预训练中的三个不同阶段，反映了上下文依赖的复杂性，指示了模型的幻觉倾向，并能可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于多种自回归架构，为理解LLM的生成动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型扩展上下文长度计算成本高昂，主要源于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏度方面存在不足。

Method: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用方法，通过置换注意力机制来增加块级稀疏度，并使用自定义的置换FlashAttention内核实现。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确率上优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，接近完整注意力基线，并在长上下文预填充中实现了最高2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种实用可行的方法，能够有效提升长上下文LLM预填充的计算效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [93] [PARL: Prompt-based Agents for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21306)
*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL方法使用大型语言模型作为强化学习智能体，通过提示工程在无需微调的情况下处理非语言推理任务，在简单环境中表现与传统RL智能体相当或更好，但在复杂数学运算和状态解码任务中存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在语言相关任务中的表现，但缺乏对LLMs在强化学习环境中处理结构化、非语言推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出PARL方法，通过提示工程将动作、状态和奖励编码到提示中，让LLMs作为RL智能体通过试错与环境交互学习，无需微调模型。

Result: 在三个标准RL任务中，PARL在简单环境中能匹配或超越传统RL智能体，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的RL智能体处理非语言推理任务，但当前方法在处理复杂数学运算和状态解码方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义不确定度具有挑战性，传统方法需要大量昂贵的生成样本

Method: 使用NLI模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越基线，相同样本数量下覆盖更多语义簇

Conclusion: 该框架作为即插即用的增强模块，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [95] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了英语中typoglycemia现象（单词内部字母乱序）对NLP模型的影响，发现模型对此具有较强鲁棒性，主要原因是少数单词会混淆且上下文差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么NLP模型在单词内部字母乱序时仍能保持良好性能，尽管许多不同单词（如form和from）在这种条件下会变成相同的表示形式。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况，评估BERT的消歧能力，通过对比在干净文本和乱序文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 字母乱序导致的性能下降比预期要小，模型表现出较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 英语中相对较少的单词会在typoglycemia下混淆，且混淆单词的上下文差异显著，使得消歧变得简单，这是模型鲁棒性的主要原因。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估大语言模型在真实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重程度和旅行者容忍度等维度，评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中经常发生的各种中断情况，需要评估LLM在动态变化环境中的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1）自动指标评估（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3）专家手动评估语义、空间、顺序和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: 实验显示LLM在顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小，表明更长的计划促进更好的地理连贯性。但随着计划长度增加，中断处理能力下降，揭示了LLM鲁棒性的局限性。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下旅行规划的适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前模型在应对复杂中断时的能力边界。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练比多轮训练在推理任务中更有效，单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都能良好泛化，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，而实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，研究多轮人机反馈训练对推理任务的必要性。

Result: 单轮训练模型在单轮和多轮评估中都有效泛化，而多轮训练模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练提供的收益有限且可能损害推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手工编写问答基准数据集，用于测试多语言模型在瑞典特定知识上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准多是翻译自美国中心的数据集，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识。

Method: 手工编写针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答数据集，灵感来自瑞典文化媒体名人访谈节目和主要体育赛事。

Result: 发现具有更强瑞典覆盖度的较小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当；继续在瑞典语上预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前知识的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集可作为研究多语言模型中语言适应和知识保留的诊断工具。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在多种NLP任务中表现有竞争力，但大规模版本并未显示出持续的性能优势，表明当前土耳其语基准可能已饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大规模预训练中代表性不足的问题，特别是为土耳其语提供首个大规模编码器语言模型。

Method: 从零开始训练，使用312GB土耳其语文本数据（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科），发布基础和大型两种配置的RoBERTa模型。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现有竞争力，大型变体在4个任务中的2个取得最佳分数，但总体上没有一致的扩展优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT作为土耳其语NLP的开放资源，同时作为关于扩展限制和语料库组成在形态丰富语言中核心作用的实证案例研究。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中展现出潜力，但在人类活动识别领域应用相对不足，且缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入描述性字幕数据集，提出综合评估方法来评估VLMs在人类活动识别中的表现，并与最先进的深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理检索结果的特点，改进传统IR指标在位置折扣和相关性定义上的不匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序阅读文档的假设，但在RAG系统中LLM会整体处理所有检索结果，且无关文档会主动降低生成质量而非仅被忽略

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关段落的正面贡献和干扰段落的负面影响，使用LLM导向的位置折扣来优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性

Result: 在5个数据集和6个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提高了36%

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

Result: MRO不仅提升了推理性能，还在保持高性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速

Conclusion: 通过优化token相关性可以显著提升扩散语言模型的推理性能，同时保持高效率

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然通过整合外部知识来减少幻觉，但模型输出仍经常与检索内容不一致。现有方法通常混淆了外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，需要准确分离这两者来进行有效的幻觉检测。

Method: 研究RAG幻觉机制，发现当后续层FFN模块不成比例地将参数知识注入残差流时会产生幻觉。基于外部上下文得分和参数知识得分，在Qwen3-0.6b上计算各层和注意力头的得分，训练回归分类器预测幻觉。

Result: 与最先进的LLM（GPT-5、GPT-4.1）和检测基线（RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker）相比，该方法表现优异。在Qwen3-0.6b上训练的检测器能够泛化到GPT-4.1-mini的响应，证明了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效、可泛化预测因子，为幻觉检测提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs对语言谱系结构有敏感性，但训练数据不平衡仍是影响多语言表现的主要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言谱系结构在LLMs多语言行为变异中的作用，特别是LLMs是否对语言属（linguistic genera）表现出敏感性。

Method: 扩展MultiQ数据集的分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度不保持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并调查知识一致性在语言属内是否比跨属更好保持。

Result: 发现属级效应存在但强烈受训练资源可用性影响，不同LLMs家族表现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs编码了属级结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

TL;DR: 提出了斯洛文尼亚语的语用理解基准SloPragEval和SloPragMega，包含405个选择题，评估LLM在语用学方面的能力，发现当前模型在理解隐含意义和文化特定表达方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，需要超越表层语言能力的更具挑战性评估，特别是语用学理解——理解情境意义、语境以及语言文化规范。

Method: 构建了斯洛文尼亚语的语用理解基准，包含405个选择题，讨论了翻译的困难，建立了人类基线，并进行了LLM的试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达的隐含意义，特别是文化特定表达时仍会失败。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征的无监督异常检测算法，应用于多语言Kokborok变体与Bangla数据集

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线，虽然精确率和召回率由于异常的微妙性质而保持适中，但高召回方法为实地工作者提供了系统标记需要验证条目的方法

Conclusion: 该方法支持低资源语言文档中数据质量的改进，为实地工作者提供系统验证工具

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但在金融任务特别是股票预测中的应用仍待探索。研究发现现有模型过度依赖分析师意见，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，未能充分利用推理能力。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动，鼓励模型从多样化信息源动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点来组织和评分涨跌证据，最后通过反思得出预测。

Result: 构建了大规模数据集（2024年全部A股，5123只股票，32K tokens长上下文，20万+样本），实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力，即使在6个月后或分布外股票上推理时间缩放仍然有效。

Conclusion: RETuning方法使模型获得关于股票预测的宝贵洞察，确保独立逻辑推理并减少上下文的不当影响，显著提升了金融预测任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Motivation: 理解信息在人类推理中如何动态积累和转换是长期挑战，现有模型无法提供统一、定量的人类推理动态描述。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为概率编码器，量化推理步骤中的信息熵和增益，通过细粒度分析建模推理动态。

Result: IF-Track成功捕捉了基本推理特征，识别了系统性错误模式，表征了个体差异，并调和了单过程与双过程理论。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论与测量之间建立了定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性洞见，揭示了人工智能与人类认知的对应关系。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Method: 使用两个独立的神经网络分别建模弹性和塑性本构定律，将物理参数作为条件输入，在包含多种场景的综合数据集上训练，实现无需重新训练即可适应不同物理参数。

Result: 实验结果显示在运动重建、鲁棒长期预测、几何泛化和精确参数估计方面达到最先进性能，验证了其作为统一模拟器和逆分析工具的通用性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了弹塑性材料建模中的泛化性和物理一致性问题，为材料模拟和参数反演提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex
materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical
scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations,
we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural
Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial
differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs
two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.
Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional
inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios
with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across
different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.
Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its
explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical
parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our
framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,
robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters
estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a
unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能通过简单的手绘草图创建BIM模型，降低BIM创建的技术门槛。

Method: 基于多模态大语言模型的多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上的实验显示：门窗检测初始准确率高，墙体检测初始准确率约83%，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐；所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可完成。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域艺术创作中要么陷入熟悉文化模式，要么为追求新颖性而牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术作品中共同出现的合理性，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术专业学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化输出和更广泛的概念探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化能够释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持连贯性的同时实现新颖性。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Conclusion: 外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题，为模糊数的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Motivation: 电子健康记录系统中药物数据的异构性是监测阿片类药物使用障碍治疗的主要障碍，关键处方属性分散在不同格式的字段和自由文本中。

Method: 使用定制化的开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）从异构数据中提取处方属性，通过固定JSON模式处理记录，并进行轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Motivation: 基于社会认识论，探讨AI系统作为人工认识权威的资格，以及如何合理地在AI和人类判断之间进行权衡，特别是在高风险情境下。

Method: 通过分析AI优先主义观点的经典反对意见（如不加批判的顺从、认识固化等），并发展出全证据观点作为替代方案。

Result: 提出了全证据观点，该观点具有三个关键优势：减轻专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认识论依据、解释AI在可靠性条件未满足时的不信任。

Conclusion: 全证据观点提供了一个原则性的方法来确定何时对AI的顺从是合理的，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度强化学习算法，能够处理观测数据中的混淆偏差，在存在未观测混淆因子的复杂高维环境中实现鲁棒学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人工智能中，学习未知环境中控制智能体的有效策略是关键任务。离线学习方法（如Q学习）允许基于过去经验做出最优决策。本文研究在复杂高维领域中从有偏数据中进行离线学习，其中未观测混淆不能先验排除。

Method: 基于著名的深度Q网络（DQN），提出了一种新颖的深度强化学习算法，对观测数据中的混淆偏差具有鲁棒性。该算法试图为与观测兼容的最坏情况环境找到安全策略。

Result: 在十二个混淆的Atari游戏中应用该方法，发现在所有行为策略和目标策略输入不匹配且存在未观测混淆因子的游戏中，该方法始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效处理观测数据中的混淆偏差，在存在未观测混淆因子的复杂环境中表现出优于标准方法的性能。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

TL;DR: 提出了PACE数据集和PACER模型，用于在恐慌发作场景中提供心理咨询支持，通过多维度评估框架PanicEval验证了模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性的恐惧和痛苦发作，及时适当的干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但由于伦理和后勤问题，训练此类模型的合适数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集（基于第一人称叙事构建的高痛苦发作数据，围绕心理急救原则结构化），训练PACER模型（提供共情和指导性支持，通过监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化），提出PanicEval多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情感改善方面均优于强基线模型。人工评估进一步证实其实际价值，在恐慌场景中一致优于通用、CBT基础和GPT-4驱动的模型。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作干预中表现出色，为心理健康支持系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，在RAG系统中实现高效知识毒化攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法忽视了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文毒化知识强相关的毒化响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过归因信号重用有潜力的知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实验，持续达到超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决知识冲突问题，实现了高效的大规模RAG知识毒化攻击。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为LLMs设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性。如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率、为领域专家提供知识整合提示是尚未解决的关键问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图(SCG)出发，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化：生成确定性推理指导，并让LLM有效利用该指导与原始输入。使用迭代优化算法基于真实数据进一步优化SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上测试，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，让小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出改进的领域特定SCG提升可解释性。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt成功解决了领域特定任务中提示设计和推理过程优化的挑战，通过自动化框架显著提升LLM性能并降低成本，同时增强模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [126] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性选择答案，显著改善了概率指令跟随(PIF)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出一个随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够改善LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，并增强生成响应的多样性。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级、无内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和零空间约束来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应环境变化同时避免遗忘。

Method: 使用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已有知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL是现实应用中持续演化零样本视觉语言模型的实用且可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Shylock方法，用于在少样本和正常多变量时间序列中发现因果关系，通过组膨胀卷积和共享核减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形标准方法，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大量数据。多变量时间序列存在数据稀缺问题，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组膨胀卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带时间延迟的变量表示。结合全局约束和局部约束实现网络间信息共享。设计了数据生成方法来生成带时间延迟的多变量时间序列。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法有效解决了多变量时间序列因果关系发现中的数据稀缺和过拟合问题，开发了Tcausal库并部署在EarthDataMiner平台上。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Conclusion: 论文概述了自主系统安全开发和运营面临的挑战及未来研究方向，强调了OOD检测在安全关键领域自主系统安全保证中的重要性。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中，不同游戏的Q值范围差异很大，需要奖励尺度无关的λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的λ策略以及五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的自适应方法。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ方法在广泛任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数后的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，分析模型推理轨迹，发现Self-Jailbreak现象，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保持有效的推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，显著优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力之间的根本权衡问题，通过系统性地引导模型推理轨迹，既提高了安全性又保持了推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

### [134] [Towards Reliable Code-as-Policies: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21302)
*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号验证和交互验证的神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过在代码生成过程中加入探索性代码来增强环境感知，显著提高了动态环境中的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境感知不足的问题，导致代码生成不准确或不完整，影响任务成功率。

Method: 提出神经符号具身任务规划框架，包含显式符号验证和交互验证过程。在验证阶段生成探索性代码，主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中评估，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作的可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成验证过程增强了生成代码的环境感知能力，提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

TL;DR: CXRAgent是一个基于LLM的导演编排多阶段代理，用于胸部X光片分析，通过工具协调、多阶段推理和团队协作来提升诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有代理依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 采用导演编排的三阶段方法：工具调用（包含证据驱动验证器）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合专家见解和上下文记忆）。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR诊断的适应性和可信度。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习的框架，提升1.5B模型在数学推理中的性能，相比纯监督微调模型准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制等测试时缩放方法依赖监督微调长上下文推理轨迹，导致小模型因冗长响应而性能下降，需要提高token效率

Method: 整合强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，在GSM8K数据集上训练SFT+RL模型

Result: SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上

Conclusion: 强化学习可以恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，整体提升数学推理性能

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的符号AI集成到LLMs的分类框架和路线图，旨在解决LLMs透明性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有的神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络，不适用于LLMs的特性，因此需要系统性地理解符号AI如何有效集成到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已有的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLMs中符号集成的新分类法，包括四个维度：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式、算法和应用层面视角。

Result: 建立了系统的分类框架，整理了现有文献，识别了当前基准、前沿进展和关键空白。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著空白，为未来研究提供了路线图，并为实现LLMs透明性的符号集成框架提供了实用见解。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习模型自动识别数学表达式并转换为优化建模语言，最终使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，开发一个能够直接从图像自动求解优化问题的端到端框架。

Method: 开发了包含三个模块的AutoOpt框架：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER任务的深度学习模型在BLEU分数上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架能够有效实现从图像到优化问题求解的自动化流程，在数学表达式识别和复杂问题求解方面表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，通过重用基础求解器来让统一求解器感知VRP变体间的共享组件特性，同时避免神经网络求解器数量的指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法通常学习统一求解器同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，每个变体都可以从一组基础VRP变体派生而来。

Method: 引入状态可分解MDP（SDMDP），将状态空间表示为与基础VRP变体相关的基础状态空间的笛卡尔积。开发基于潜在空间的SDMDP扩展，结合最优基础策略和可学习的混合函数。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上进行的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过重用基础求解器，使统一求解器能够感知VRP变体间的共享组件特性，同时避免了神经网络求解器数量的指数增长，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个可验证的人工策划基准，用于评估LLM代理在欧盟法律背景下的合规性，特别是在良性用户输入可能导致非法行为的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种环境中部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行为的潜在倾向。

Method: 引入EU-Agent-Bench基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别场景。通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较，评估前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究在系统提示中提供相关立法摘录对合规性的影响。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来的工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同的法律管辖区，以及多轮和多语言交互。代码已公开发布。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和结构化事实可信推理机制，解决了LLM智能体在长程推理中验证不足的问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长程推理失败往往不是因为生成能力弱，而是由于中间推理验证不足。需要一种可证伪、可审计的推理过程来确保可靠性。

Method: 采用两种互补机制：冲突感知元验证将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，只在专家智能体间的分歧热点分配计算；结构化事实可信推理通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。消融研究证实结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了这些改进。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体的可靠长程推理提供了一个可扩展的范式，通过TRSF和CAMV形成闭环验证循环，确保推理的透明性和可信性。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用演示学习（ICL）训练神经控制屏障函数（CBF）的方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅需专家演示数据即可实现安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统方法需要明确指定失败状态集，但在许多实际场景中（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），失败状态难以形式化定义，而生成专家演示数据相对容易。

Method: 使用ICL训练约束函数对系统状态进行分类（安全/不安全），然后用该函数标注模拟轨迹数据来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中实证评估，该方法优于现有基线，与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的安全控制方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅依赖专家演示即可实现有效的安全保证。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设编码代理在软件工程基准测试中表现更好意味着其后续自我修改潜力更大，但作者发现了元生产力与性能之间的不匹配问题。

Method: 基于Huxley的clade概念提出CMP指标，衡量代理后代的基准测试表现作为自我改进潜力指标，构建HGM系统来估计CMP并指导自我修改树的搜索。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于现有方法且用时更少。优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能，匹配人类工程化编码代理的最佳结果。

Conclusion: HGM通过准确估计自我改进潜力，有效解决了元生产力与性能不匹配问题，在编码代理自我改进方面取得了显著进展，并展现出良好的迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

TL;DR: AstaBench是一个用于严格评估AI科学代理的基准套件，包含2400多个科学发现过程的问题，提供可复现的工具环境和全面的基线代理，评估显示AI在科学辅助方面仍有很大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在多方面不足：无法提供真实科学研究的整体衡量、缺乏可复现的工具、未考虑成本等混杂变量、缺少标准化接口和全面基线代理，阻碍了AI科学代理的进步。

Method: 提出了AstaBench基准套件，包含2400多个涵盖整个科学发现过程和多领域的问题，提供生产级搜索工具的科学研究环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线代理。

Result: 对22类57个代理的广泛评估显示，尽管在某些方面取得有意义的进展，但AI在解决科学辅助挑战方面仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的基准来评估AI科学代理，AstaBench提供了这样的框架，但当前AI在科学辅助方面的能力仍然有限。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，不限制目标本体或实体的数量。该方法在三个生物医学任务中表现优异，在类选择方面优于基线方法，并在两个任务中F1分数达到63%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面知识图谱需要使用多个本体来完整地将数据上下文化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要更复杂的多本体匹配方法来建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次结构上的来源信息。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成策略，选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。这是第一个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，不限制目标本体或实体的数量。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务的评估中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法，在两个任务中F1分数达到63%以上，在第三个任务中排名第二。对非参考映射的手动评估显示，46%的映射获得了最高分，进一步证实了其构建语义合理映射的能力。

Conclusion: CMOMgen是首个能够生成完整且语义合理映射的端到端复杂多本体匹配策略，在生物医学领域的多个任务中表现出色，证明了专用策略在复杂本体匹配中的重要性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，用于分析能源公司公关视频中的框架类型，特别是检测绿色创新等环境信息框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题，如石油天然气公司的"漂绿"现象。需要大规模理解框架及其变化来揭示公关活动的目标和本质。

Method: 构建了专家标注的Facebook和YouTube视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型，覆盖50多家公司和20个国家，专门用于评估视觉语言模型。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息，F1分数达79%，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐性框架、不同长度视频和隐性文化背景方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于知识图谱的框架，解决自主智能体在动态环境中高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主智能体协调中高层任务语义与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟，使复杂协调路径能够通过简单修改知识图谱中的事实来调整。

Method: 采用双平面架构的知识图谱作为智能翻译层，将声明性事实编译为每个智能体的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，实现任务语义与领域无关规划器的解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.
