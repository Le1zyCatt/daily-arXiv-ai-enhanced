### [1] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度敏感性评分来解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角渲染时的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的视角渲染时会出现严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据导致模型在密度、颜色和几何预测上存在不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感性评分，明确针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性，而不是各向同性方差。该方法直接解决生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法相比现有的基于神经辐射场的方法（如BayesRays）显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该过滤方法能够实时无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染管线中，无需进行大量的后训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角之外时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [2] [From Far and Near: Perceptual Evaluation of Crowd Representations Across Levels of Detail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20558)
*Xiaohan Sun,Carol O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究用户对不同细节层次和观看距离下人群角色视觉质量的感知，比较几何网格、图像代理、NeRF和3D高斯等表示方法的视觉保真度与计算性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何设计感知优化的细节层次策略，以在人群渲染中平衡视觉质量和计算效率。

Method: 使用定性分析和定量评估，比较四种不同表示方法在不同细节层次和观看距离下的视觉质量。

Result: 不同表示方法在视觉保真度和计算性能方面存在明显权衡，为人群渲染的细节层次策略设计提供了指导。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计感知优化的细节层次人群渲染策略提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd
character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing
distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between
visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative
results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD
strategies for crowd rendering.

### [3] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习来检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过二维离散傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络，在频域中检测周期性伪影，准确率达92.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络产生的逼真图像对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统构成严重挑战，需要有效区分真实图像和GAN生成图像的方法。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到傅里叶域，利用ResNet50神经网络在频域中训练模型来区分真实和合成图像。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征或"指纹"，结合信号处理技术和深度学习的方法在增强数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [4] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合用于3D形状特征表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时的困难，包括需要大量标注数据和CNN可能忽略关键形状关系的问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标（包括监督对比损失和自监督对比损失）相结合，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比损失达到了约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT能够捕捉全局形状语义，而对比学习优化局部判别特征，这种结合克服了传统方法对大量标注数据的依赖和CNN在形状关系建模上的局限性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [5] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器改进现有3D检测器，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上实现了74.7 aMOTA的强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法在多模态传感器特征利用方面存在不足，需要开发能够有效融合相机和LiDAR数据的跟踪框架，以在遮挡和视角变化下实现鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用基于查询的跟踪框架，包含多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程。融合跟踪器集成边界框与多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型。在跟踪前使用时域平滑器在移动窗口上精炼边界框序列。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出色，减少了身份切换同时保持竞争性精度。相比单传感器方法，多模态传感器特征显著提升了基于transformer的跟踪方法性能。

Conclusion: FutrTrack提供了一个高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练，也能改进基于transformer的跟踪器与其他神经网络方法竞争。多模态传感器特征对查询式transformer跟踪方法有显著益处。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [6] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑（OLS）通过动态调整软标签来改进医学图像分类，相比传统方法在准确率和特征表示上均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，传统标签平滑方法无法考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑（OLS）方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签，并在RadImageNet数据集上评估ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均优于标准训练方法，同时产生更紧凑和分离良好的特征嵌入，表明表示学习得到改善。

Conclusion: OLS不仅提升了预测性能，还增强了模型校准，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [7] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对鱼眼相机交通监控的检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道增强检测一致性，结合多种先进检测模型的集成策略，在AI City Challenge Track 4中获得第8名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其强径向失真和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，训练多个先进检测模型并通过集成策略结合它们的输出，以提高整体检测精度。

Result: 在2025年AI City Challenge Track 4中获得了0.6366的F1分数，在62个团队中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的问题，在强失真条件下实现了稳健的检测性能。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [8] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个混合两阶段框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，通过多角度采集和变换器超分辨率编码器-解码器，实现准确的脑组织声速图重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理方法受颅骨引起的信号衰减和空间覆盖不完整限制，纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下产生定量偏差的声速图。

Method: 第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于变换器的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合片段；采用可移动低计数换能器部分阵列采集策略。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验显示，BrainPuzzle实现了优越的声速重建精度和图像完整性。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，通过混合算法补偿缺失孔径，在低信噪比条件下保持结构细节。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [9] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，特别关注图像到图像编辑系统，发现这些模型倾向于默认使用全球北方、现代风格的描绘，迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且文化敏感编辑在当前系统中不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑系统研究不足。该研究旨在填补这一空白，通过标准化协议评估两种系统，提供可比较的诊断结果。

Method: 使用统一评估框架，涵盖六个国家、8个类别/36个子类别，以及时代感知提示。结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和来自本地评审的专家人类判断。使用固定设置的开放模型进行跨国家、跨时代和跨类别评估。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 在国家无关提示下，模型默认使用全球北方、现代风格的描绘，削弱了跨国差异；(2) 迭代图像到图像编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，即使传统指标保持稳定或改善；(3) 图像到图像模型应用表面线索而非时代一致、上下文感知的变化，常为全球南方目标保留源身份。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑不可靠。通过发布标准化数据、提示和人类评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现、以文化为中心的基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [10] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像。该方法使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号，通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并应用高斯滤波，在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖GPU上的神经网络，复杂且计算量大。需要一种更简单、异步且能在CPU上高效运行的事件图像重建方法。

Method: 1. 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号强度变化；2. 通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素；3. 对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波；4. 支持任意时间点的异步图像读取。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度达42-140百万事件/秒。重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如基准标记检测。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步事件图像重建方案，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在特定应用场景下足够使用，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

### [11] [Data-Adaptive Transformed Bilateral Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20077)
*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，有效捕捉全局相关性，同时利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，并整合ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数正则化处理复杂噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效捕捉全局和局部相关性的方法。

Method: 提出TBTLRR模型，引入数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，整合ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数正则化，采用基于ADMM的高效优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升了张量低秩表示的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源的跨平台应用程序，用于标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和外科数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中具有潜力，但受限于异构的视频记录格式和视频共享的隐私问题。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期和用户中心反馈开发，通过隐私设计架构，结合可用性启发式和技术接受模型进行评估。

Result: 用户报告高可用性（4.38/5）、感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [13] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，通过将自注意力机制的两个关键原则（自适应路由和侧向抑制）注入到卷积操作中，解决了传统卷积与自注意力之间的性能差距，在多个视觉任务中超越了自注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但存在二次复杂度瓶颈；而卷积虽然计算效率高，但性能始终落后于自注意力。本文旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计一种兼具两者优势的新方法。

Method: 揭示了自注意力的两个关键原则：自适应路由（动态调节位置信息流）和侧向抑制（通过分数竞争抑制冗余）。基于这些原则提出了ATConv，将这两个机制融入卷积操作中，同时保持3×3卷积核的线性复杂度。

Result: ATConv在基础视觉任务中一致优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中，用ATConv替换自注意力可将FID降低0.15，并实现更快的采样。

Conclusion: 通过将自注意力的核心原则注入卷积操作，ATConv成功弥合了卷积与自注意力之间的性能差距，提供了一种兼具高效计算和强大表达能力的新范式。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StableSketcher框架，通过优化VAE编码器和引入基于VQA的奖励函数，使扩散模型能够生成具有高提示保真度的手绘草图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面取得进展，但在生成像素级手绘草图（抽象表达的代表）方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数，提高文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher生成的草图具有改进的风格保真度，与提示的对齐效果优于Stable Diffusion基线。

Conclusion: 提出了首个包含实例级草图、标题和问答对的数据集SketchDUO，解决了现有数据集依赖图像-标签对的局限性。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学领域缺乏大规模、实例特定的描述性标题，限制了自然语言监督在生物多模态基础模型中的应用，而图像和标题可以看作是物种潜在形态空间的互补样本。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科的视觉信息和针对特定分类群的格式示例，以减少幻觉并产生准确的实例描述性标题，然后训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签，在连接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法能够从单张图像有效生成光场，为光场技术的广泛应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其余logit之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分离性，在多种OOD检测场景中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法往往未充分利用模型logits空间中丰富的信息，需要更有效地利用logit空间来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与剩余logit的关系，并引入无需训练的策略自动识别最有信息的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多样化OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间关系，为OOD检测提供了简单而强大的解决方案，具有理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和可用性。PartNeXt旨在解决这些限制，推动计算机视觉、图形学和机器人学中部件级理解的发展。

Method: 构建包含23,000+高质量纹理3D模型的数据集，标注50个类别的细粒度层次化部件标签，并在类无关部件分割和3D部件问答两个任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 在部件分割任务中，现有方法在细粒度和叶级部件上表现不佳；在3D部件问答任务中，3D-LLM在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距；使用PartNeXt训练的Point-SAM相比PartNet有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张RGB图像进行类别级8D姿态估计的方法，用于估计铰接式自行车和骑行者的姿态，包括自行车的3D平移、旋转以及车把和踏板的旋转角度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于易受伤害道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于交叉意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统的6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车铰接部件（如车把、踏板）的变化，这些变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点的模型，使用合成和真实图像数据进行混合训练，以在真实图像上实现泛化。8D姿态包括3D平移、3D旋转以及车把和踏板相对于自行车车架的旋转。

Result: 该方法在8D姿态参数估计精度方面表现出有希望的结果，与使用刚性规范对象模板匹配的最先进类别级6D姿态估计器相比，取得了竞争性的分数。

Conclusion: 通过引入8D姿态估计，能够更精细地描述自行车姿态状态和行驶方向，为自动驾驶系统中的骑行者行为理解和安全决策提供了更准确的信息。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层作为可学习的潜在分布，与生成器联合端到端训练，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAEs竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分方面优于β-VAEs和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架成功实现了GAN的无监督解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中的时间一致性问题，传统方法在建模长期时间依赖时面临计算成本与性能的权衡困境。

Method: 提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权选择帧进行时空聚合，模拟人类两阶段决策过程。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上达到0.62/1.11 TEPE（相比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%），同时计算成本更低，实现了最先进的精度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程有效维护了紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区，实现了高效的时空一致性信息聚合。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: 连续可疑建模方法能实现更早检测和主动干预，显著提升系统可解释性和安全应用实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Result: 大量消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建，实现了更好的图像编辑效果，在保持源图像一致性的同时能够进行忠实的修改。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题，需要开发更可靠的客观检测方法以评估产前健康。

Method: 使用自监督对比学习框架CURL，结合空间和时间双重对比损失，采用任务特定采样策略分离运动和非运动片段，并通过概率微调方法实现灵活推理。

Result: 在包含92名受试者、每人30分钟超声记录的数据集上，CURL实现了78.01%的敏感性和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改进产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: EditInfinity通过利用VQ生成模型的精确中间表示特性，实现了更精确的图像编辑，在保持源图像保真度和文本语义对齐方面具有优势。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来解决大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时产生的幻觉问题，发现幻觉风险主要源于对上下文依赖的增加而非文本长度本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时容易产生幻觉，传统观点认为这是由长度导致的错误累积，但本文旨在探究是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架：通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了持续显著的改进，验证了框架的有效性，同时重新验证了关于上下文的假设。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了性能提升，更重要的是为深入探索LVLMs长文本响应中的幻觉问题提供了新见解和第一步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

TL;DR: COS3D是一个协作式提示-分割框架，通过实例场和语言场的协同工作，有效整合语言和分割线索，解决了现有基于高斯泼溅的开放词汇3D分割方法的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的开放词汇3D分割方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致误差累积。需要一种能够有效整合语言和分割线索的方法。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作式框架有效解决了开放词汇3D分割的挑战，在性能和通用性方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround是一个双分支架构的视频时序定位方法，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频与语言的对齐，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频时序定位方法在处理跨模态注意力时对所有文本标记一视同仁，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而无法有效利用词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐的能力。

Method: 提出DualGround双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类成语短语级单元进行局部定位；引入标记角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中是有效的，能够同时捕获粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；整合为端到端EDGeo框架。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景下实现了最先进的性能，定位精度提升3.39%。

Conclusion: 本工作为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范例和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Result: 在四个数据集上达到或超越SOTA性能，在语义不一致场景下表现尤为突出

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Result: 在四个主要数据集上达到最先进性能，消融实验验证了冗余信息减少带来的改进

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过细粒度多模态特征融合有效减少了视频异常检测中的冗余信息，显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了CV-SAR图像识别的表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DMC³框架，通过反事实样本构建和对比优化来解决第一人称视频问答中的多事件理解和手-物交互识别挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了第一人称视角带来的独特挑战，如理解多个事件和识别手-物交互，需要专门的方法来处理这些问题。

Method: DMC³框架包含三个模块：基础模型、反事实样本构建模块（通过事件描述改写和核心交互挖掘生成正负样本）、以及反事实样本参与的对比优化模块。

Result: 在EgoTaskQA的normal和indirect分割上分别达到52.51%和46.04%，在QAEGO4D上达到13.2%，均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的DMC³框架有效解决了第一人称视频问答中的独特挑战，在多个基准测试中取得了最佳性能。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）优化GUI grounding性能，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽略了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，利用指令多样性可在推理时获得76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 采用Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径。提出两阶段训练框架：首先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT）以培养多视角推理能力，然后通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B在五个挑战性grounding基准测试中达到SOTA：UI-I2E-Bench 87.3%、ScreenSpot-Pro 57.0%、MMBench-GUI L2 84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了grounding性能，还展示了涌现推理能力，能够在推理时选择性组合和合成新的指令路径。同时解决了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language

between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a

augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET提出了一种高效的多模态大语言模型训练范式，通过双曲空间中的动态半径调整来优化视觉表示，使其在任意粒度级别上与文本对齐，显著减少了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要极高的计算资源（如数千个GPU）进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP和SAM）缺乏与语言在多粒度级别上的对齐。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构的能力，通过动态双曲半径调整优化视觉表示；采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，提供三种高效参数化策略：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试上的综合实验表明，HyperET仅需增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET为MLLMs提供了一种高效训练范式，通过双曲空间解决了视觉与文本模态间的粒度差距问题，显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

TL;DR: AnyPcc是一个通用的点云压缩框架，通过通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调策略解决泛化问题，在15个数据集上达到最先进的压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对分布外数据处理的低效性。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕获鲁棒的上下文依赖；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个多样化数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

TL;DR: AccuQuant是一种新的扩散模型后训练量化方法，通过模拟多步去噪过程来最小化量化误差累积，显著降低内存复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的量化误差会在采样过程中的多个去噪步骤中累积，影响模型性能。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法有效解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant在几个去噪步骤内最小化全精度扩散模型与其量化版本之间的输出差异，显式模拟扩散采样过程进行量化，考虑多步去噪的累积误差。

Result: AccuQuant在标准基准测试的各种任务和扩散模型上表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，提供了一种高效且有效的扩散模型量化方法，显著降低了内存需求。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现DiT中patch tokens即使位置编码被扰动仍能产生全局一致输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制，这启发了对位置编码系统的重新设计。

Method: 引入位置编码场(PE-Field)，将位置编码从2D扩展到结构化3D场，包含深度感知编码用于体积推理和分层编码用于细粒度子patch控制。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成任务中达到最先进性能，并能泛化到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: PE-Field通过扩展位置编码到3D场，使DiT能够直接在3D空间中建模几何，显著提升了视觉生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的因果方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习来缓解偏见，从而改进图像到食谱检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 采用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习，以缓解表示学习中的偏见。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化美食数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的食材和烹饪动作，在两个数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法能够有效缓解图像到食谱检索中的表示偏见，提高对细微差异的识别能力，在单语和多语言多文化场景下均表现优异。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的视频推理方法依赖纯文本链，导致结论缺乏视觉基础或产生幻觉；而基于帧检索的方法虽然引入视觉基础，但在证据定位上仍不准确。

Method: 构建了Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，包含帧识别、证据推理和行动决策；设计了多阶段渐进式冷启动策略与识别-推理-行动强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在六个多步推理基准测试中，Conan平均比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan框架在多步视频推理任务中表现出色，并能有效泛化到长视频理解任务，验证了其强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，并承诺公开数据集、代码、模型和评估工具以促进透明度和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Motivation: 当前一步扩散模型虽然能快速生成高质量图像，但在个性化新概念方面能力有限，因为单步模型难以有效捕捉新概念的分布特征。

Method: 采用端到端训练，同时训练多步扩散模型(教师)和一步扩散模型(学生)，通过双向概念蒸馏机制：概念从教师蒸馏到学生，然后从学生反馈给教师，并共享文本编码器确保语义一致性。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型建立了一种快速有效个性化的新范式，通过双向协作机制解决了单步模型个性化能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出Metis-HOME混合专家框架，通过思考分支和非思考分支的混合架构，解决多模态大模型在复杂推理与通用能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询也使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专门推理会损害其更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B构建混合专家架构，包含专门处理复杂多步推理的思考分支和优化快速直接推理的非思考分支，通过轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。

Result: 该方法不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专门化模型中观察到的退化趋势。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且多功能多模态大模型的新范式，有效解决了普遍存在的推理与泛化之间的困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域概念划分和Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注中对伪造痕迹的描述不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本解释与视觉证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 1. 定义面部图像概念树(FICT)对面部图像进行细粒度区域划分；2. 开发FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；3. 提出Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，生成穿插分割掩码的文本伪造解释；4. 设计统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度的数据标注和模型架构设计，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中的性能，实现了文本解释与视觉证据的更好关联。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合估计模糊图像中潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹的深度学习框架，通过可微分模糊创建模块实现端到端训练，在严重模糊情况下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过神经网络预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的恢复网络进行端到端训练，并通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在严重或空间变化模糊情况下实现了最先进的性能，优于端到端去模糊网络。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化架构不仅提供了可解释性，还能重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，为运动模糊恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To

TL;DR: ACamera-Net是一个轻量级、场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，直接从RAW输入预测最佳曝光和白平衡，提升复杂光照条件下的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像流程中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需依赖额外图像增强模块，就能有效解决复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题，为消费级相机系统提供了一种高效的参数调整解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式的时空证据到视频推理中，在回答时同时突出关键时间戳、对象和边界框，使推理能够基于具体的视觉观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型只生成文本推理轨迹，不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。虽然OpenAI-o3等模型在图像上引发了证据中心推理的广泛兴趣，但将此能力扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要跨动态场景的联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 首先构建了两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，提供统一的时空监督和推理轨迹。然后采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计了多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中，Open-o3 Video实现了最先进的性能，在Qwen2.5-VL基线上将mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等广泛视频理解基准测试中也观察到一致的改进。

Conclusion: 除了准确性外，Open-o3 Video生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，无法准确匹配文本提示中指定的颜色。现有基准测试缺乏对颜色精度的系统性评估，而颜色在人类视觉感知和实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建基准测试，包含数值颜色表示，通过感知评估和自动化评估相结合的方式评估模型性能。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度和失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench基准测试将指导精确颜色生成技术的改进，该基准将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架在跨模态分割任务中表现出色，原型对比学习进一步提升了性能

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动对象的重建问题，提供全面而紧凑的对象覆盖，具有恒定的计算成本优势。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架有效提升了长视频理解的性能

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 当前3D医学影像视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率长序列体积时存在困难：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不对齐，切片标记化模糊精细解剖结构，降低下游任务诊断性能。

Method: 提出BTB3D因果卷积编码器-解码器，统一2D和3D训练推理，生成紧凑的频率感知体素标记。采用三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺、长上下文解码器精炼。

Result: 在报告生成任务上，BLEU分数提升，临床F1比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务上，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化而非更大的语言骨干网络，对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

TL;DR: 本文提出UltraHR-100K数据集和频率感知后训练方法，解决了超高分辨率文本到图像生成中缺乏高质量数据集和细粒度细节合成训练策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集和针对细粒度细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 1) 引入UltraHR-100K数据集（10万张超高分辨率图像）；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样和软加权频率正则化。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试中，该方法显著提高了超高分辨率图像生成的细粒度细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据集和训练策略有效提升了超高分辨率文本到图像生成的细节质量，为相关研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多比特量化网络方法存在显著的训练开销问题，因为每个支持的比特宽度都需要重复全数据集更新，且需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项。

Method: 1) 权重偏置校正：通过中和跨比特宽度的量化诱导偏置和对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化并消除微调需求；2) 比特级核心集采样策略：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性评分选择紧凑信息子集进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争性或更优准确率的同时，训练时间减少高达7.88倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多比特量化网络的训练开销问题，通过权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样实现了高效的训练，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种新颖的KV缓存压缩方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化大型视觉语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法适应头级语义冗余，在压缩KV对时选择性平衡多样性和重要性，通过分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中表现出的不同冗余水平来实现优化压缩。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别实现8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持可比的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性，有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩中的语义覆盖问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，并可无缝扩展到LLMs中。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是一种传感器无关的方法，能够从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损距离图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点损失和完整点云重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法来满足高精度遥感应用的需求。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断关键参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光的校准校正，实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在完整KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保留，所有点云中零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完全几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理密集交织文本注释和细粒度图形元素的信息密集型图像时，难以精确定位关键线索并进行多跳推理来整合分散证据。

Method: 采用受推测解码启发的训练免费框架：草稿阶段使用小型VLM作为草稿专家生成多样化定位候选的推理路径；裁决阶段由强VLM合成这些路径产生最终答案；引入共识专家选择机制仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准上取得一致增益，相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现错误纠正和成本效率。

Conclusion: SV通过从多个部分准确的推理路径中合成正确见解，在无需训练的情况下有效解决了密集信息图像中的多跳推理挑战，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在超高分辨率图像生成时面临自注意力机制二次方计算成本的问题，现有方法难以高效扩展到训练分辨率之外。

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段相匹配。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的超高分辨率图像生成方案，显著扩展了预训练模型的能力范围。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

TL;DR: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的冲突目标，采用课程学习策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow，在ImageNet-1K 256x256上实现了最先进的生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个术语存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow框架，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用标准DiT骨干网络实现了FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)的最新成果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像准确推断相机位姿、3D形状和纹理的挑战，将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，实现位姿和形状的联合估计。

Method: 采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于位姿恢复；精阶段集成位姿对齐图像特征来增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在PSNR上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在位姿精度上匹配单目估计器，在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了准确的相机位姿、3D形状和纹理的联合推断，在多个指标上优于现有领先方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ARGenSeg，一种基于自回归生成的图像分割新范式，在统一框架内实现多模态理解和像素级感知，通过图像生成方式自然产生目标对象的密集掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像分割集成到多模态大语言模型中时，通常使用边界点表示或专用分割头，这些方法依赖离散表示或语义提示输入任务特定解码器，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 引入基于图像生成的MLLM分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，使分割完全依赖于MLLM的像素级理解。采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需视觉标记以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过图像生成范式成功实现了多模态大语言模型中的高效图像分割，在性能和速度方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

*Dean L Slack,G Thomas Hudson,Thomas Winterbottom,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，通过连续像素空间表示和简单的端到端训练，在物理模拟视频预测中显著提升了时间预测范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型性能和可扩展性的启发，研究将Transformer架构应用于视频预测领域，特别关注现有视频生成方法在物理模拟时间建模方面的不足。

Method: 使用纯Transformer模型进行自回归视频预测，采用连续像素空间表示，比较不同的时空自注意力布局，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。

Result: 与现有潜在空间方法相比，该方法将物理准确预测的时间范围延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持相当性能。通过可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

### [82] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SpectraMorph框架，通过物理引导的自监督融合方法解决高光谱图像超分辨率问题，使用解混瓶颈结构，在MSI仅有单波段时仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失败。需要一种既能保持高性能又具有物理可解释性的融合方法。

Method: 使用解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，采用自监督训练方式。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph框架提供了可解释的中间结果，训练时间短（不到一分钟），在MSI波段很少时仍保持鲁棒性，是高性能且物理可解释的HSI-MSI融合解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM)，一个基于潜在变量扩展的通用模态转换框架，能够在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的桥梁，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但扩展到跨模态转换仍面临挑战。现有方法依赖限制性假设，如共享维度、高斯先验和模态特定架构，限制了通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中操作，引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练，探索多种训练策略提高稳定性。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务中表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成。综合实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LDDBM建立了一个强大的通用模态转换基准，支持任意模态对，为跨模态生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体位于独立层；采用锁定机制保持选定层高保真度，其余层灵活适应上下文；无需架构修改，利用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 在多个主体个性化图像生成中，相比最先进方法，LayerComposer实现了更优的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过分层表示和锁定机制，有效解决了多主体个性化生成中的空间控制和身份保持问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine模型通过整体生成整个场景来解决文本到视频模型在创建连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，实现了从第一个镜头到最后一个镜头的全局一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的"叙事鸿沟"，这些模型擅长生成孤立片段但无法创建连贯的叙事，而叙事是故事讲述的核心。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，同时使用稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集，镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成所需的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到了新的最先进水平，并发展出显著的新兴能力：对角色和场景的持久记忆，以及对电影技术的直观理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平。该模型在四个KC类别上取得了0.836的宏平均F1分数，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析在线科学学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的教育话语分析。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化来处理类别不平衡和增强泛化能力。构建了包含20,000个手动标注样本的平衡语料库。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC取得了0.836±0.008的宏平均F1分数，显著优于传统和Transformer基线方法(p<0.01)。模型对高阶认知参与（特别是Explore和Negotiate类别）表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估工具的开发提供了可扩展的理论指导方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的质量，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，提示框架结构主要影响事实准确性和教学完整性。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型和RACE框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，比较不同模型和提示框架对生成质量的影响。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教学计划，Claude生成语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有模型的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶认知层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖提示框架。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动精炼而非被动去噪来解决训练-推理差异导致的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中面临训练-推理差异的严重问题，初始令牌错误会在并行解码中污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，导致语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误，建立基础修订能力；然后实施在线自校正循环，让模型学习从专家修正中改进自己的错误草稿，实现错误驱动学习。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动精炼框架有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出了Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，解决了传统方法在百万token上下文下内存需求过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统注意力分析技术因二次方复杂度而需要TB级内存，限制了长上下文的可解释性分析。

Method: 提出了Stream算法，使用可编译的分层剪枝方法估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码，在近线性时间和线性空间内完成，通过二分搜索式细化保留每个查询的前k个关键块。

Result: 在长思维链推理中识别出思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，暴露从针到输出的层间路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Motivation: HIV的高效筛查和早期诊断对减少传播至关重要。虽然大规模实验室检测不可行，但电子健康记录的广泛应用为解决这一挑战提供了新机会。现有研究主要关注结构化数据，而忽略了可能包含HIV风险相关信息的非结构化文本数据。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的流程，利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，评估患者进行HIV进一步检测的资格。

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹的临床数据上进行实验，结果显示该流程在保持低假阴性率的同时实现了高准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本在HIV筛查中的有效性，为HIV早期诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

TL;DR: 该研究首次对大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现进行了专家基准测试，评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务中的表现，发现37%的响应包含不准确信息，幻觉率高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLM在生命周期评估中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统评估，需要建立标准化的评估框架来指导实践。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM（包括商业和开源模型）在22个LCA相关任务中的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准进行专家评审，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的幻觉引用率高达40%；开源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上与闭源模型表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是在将LLM视为自由形式的神谕时，但也显示了在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without

TL;DR: 提出基于游戏的评估方法，使用Dixit卡牌游戏来全面评估多模态大语言模型的能力，解决传统基准测试的主观性和模型利用表面捷径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型评估存在静态基准测试无法综合评估能力、人工或模型比较主观且昂贵、模型可能利用冗长等表面捷径提高胜率等问题。

Method: 提出基于游戏的评估框架，使用Dixit幻想卡牌游戏，要求玩家为卡片生成能够欺骗部分但非全部玩家的标题，通过游戏胜率客观评估模型能力。

Result: 五个多模态大语言模型的Dixit胜率排名与流行基准测试排名完全一致，同时游戏揭示了人类与模型玩家策略的差异以及模型推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面、客观和有趣的评估框架，能够揭示模型能力的真实表现和改进方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究评估DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的应用潜力，通过四个基准测试和多种缓解策略来减少幻觉并提高模型输出准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型，LLMs有潜力通过自然语言理解和代码生成来弥合这一表述差距，但现有模型存在高成本和幻觉问题。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1模型，在NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR四个基准上进行系统评估，采用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高且性能良好的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准上表现成功，但在应用运筹学场景中的有效性仍需探索。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中具有应用潜力，通过适当的缓解策略可以有效减少幻觉并提高模型输出的准确性和用户意图对齐度。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和提炼任务级指导，在不更新参数的情况下从标记示例中学习分类函数，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的LLM学习方式。

Method: 使用情节记忆存储实例级批评，语义记忆提炼可重用的任务级指导，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评进行学习。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，融入批评比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思性学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了前景。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个用于可控歌词翻译的无监督框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上取得了最先进的结果，训练步骤减少近40%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式和在段落级别有效泛化，而跨行连贯性和全局押韵在段落级别至关重要

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式运行，通过逐步增加复杂度的挑战来指导模型

Result: 在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上都达到了最先进水平，自适应课程策略使训练步骤减少近40%

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高了训练效率

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合方法，将大语言模型的广泛覆盖能力与符号自然语言理解的结构化表示能力相结合，以解决各自方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和不一致输出问题，而符号NLU系统虽然可解释但覆盖范围有限且维护困难。作者希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，同时使用符号NLU生成结构化关系表示用于推理和增量学习。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号管道。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser

Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA依赖简化的问答形式，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程。

Method: 提出基于临床背景和临床问题两个维度的分类范式，总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术方法，并扩展评估指标。

Result: 该范式能够澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的LLMs。

Conclusion: 提出的统一范式为临床决策任务的评估提供了清晰框架，有助于开发更符合临床实际需求的LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了希腊语嵌入模型(GEM)，通过精心策划的大规模希腊语语料库训练多种现代Transformer架构，解决了希腊语NLP研究中架构单一、上下文长度受限的问题，特别是在法律领域取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希腊语等形态丰富的中等资源语言在NLP研究中面临研究碎片化、架构多样性不足和上下文长度限制等问题，特别是在需要处理长文档的法律领域，现有模型往往局限于早期Transformer架构和512个token的窗口。

Method: 构建大规模希腊语语料库，采用严格的质量驱动过滤和预处理方法；在精心策划的数据基础上预训练多种现代架构（ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT）；提出首个面向法律领域的希腊语-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 在下游任务上的广泛实验表明，新模型类别证明了所提方法的有效性，特别是GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过质量驱动的数据策划和多样化的现代架构应用，成功提升了希腊语NLP性能，特别是在法律领域的长文档处理能力，为中等资源语言的NLP研究提供了有效范例。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，需要针对性地改进模型适应方法。

Method: 1) 在事件触发检测任务中引入领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号构建多任务模型；2) 修改自回归大语言模型架构，实现层间双向信息流；3) 使用生成式监督上下文微调框架结合响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过针对性迁移学习范式适应的预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的最佳性能需要通过针对性的迁移学习范式来实现，论文提出的三种改进策略有效提升了模型适应效果。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实工具集中存在冗余工具和重叠描述，导致工具选择模糊性；同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集

Method: 提出ToolScope框架：(1) ToolScopeMerger带自动校正功能，自动审计和修复工具合并以减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对工具进行排序和选择，仅保留最相关工具以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%至38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware

Motivation: 提升小语言模型在专业领域（如医学问答）的推理能力，特别是在波斯语等资源匮乏语言中，解决数据有限的问题。

Method: 将医学多选题数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理构建包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集，然后进行DPO训练。

Result: 训练后的模型在医学推理能力上显著提升，性能超越了使用5700万token训练的前代模型，尽管本方法仅使用了更小的数据集（450万token）。

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，能够高效开发领域特定的语言模型，证明了RLAIF和DPO在小语言模型优化中的有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一的评估框架，需要从多维度系统性地评估模型的创造力。

Method: 构建CreativityPrism框架，包含发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理三个领域，9个任务和20个评估指标，对17个先进的大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，跨领域相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力评估需要多维度综合考量，单一任务或维度的表现不能代表整体创造力水平，支持了创造力不是单一固定概念的观点。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接需要大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂。

Method: 使用候选生成、上下文评分、自适应路由和选择性推理的流水线，将实体分为简单和困难两类，分别用低成本链接器和LLM推理处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升最高达4.47%，平均提升2.53%，在6个数据集中的5个表现更好，且LLM令牌使用量减少一半。

Conclusion: ARTER通过智能路由和选择性LLM推理，实现了高效且高性能的实体链接，平衡了计算成本和性能。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种高效的方法，用于对长结构化文本进行token级分割和标签预测，通过仅生成起始token序列并定位原文本中的内容来减少推理成本，使用强化学习和中间候选策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的分割方法。

Method: BoundRL提出联合执行token级文本分割和标签预测，仅生成起始token序列，通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，并构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂提示分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示，RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，中间候选策略进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割方法，通过减少推理成本和最小化幻觉，在LLM应用中的复杂提示分割任务上表现出色。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在立场检测任务中存在显著偏见，会错误地将特定观点与某些社会群体特征（如方言、文本复杂度）关联


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在立场检测中的偏见，这是最敏感的NLP任务之一，但此前被社区忽视

Method: 在现有立场检测数据集中自动标注帖子属性（方言/文本复杂度），研究这些属性如何影响模型的立场检测决策

Result: LLMs表现出显著刻板印象，如错误地将支持大麻观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联

Conclusion: LLMs在零样本立场检测中继承了预训练数据的刻板印象，存在明显的偏见问题

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

*Tian Lan,Bin Zhu,Qianghuai Jia,Junyang Ren,Haijun Li,Longyue Wang,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepWideSearch是首个专门评估信息搜索代理在深度推理和广度信息收集方面能力的基准测试，包含220个跨15个领域的问题，现有最先进代理的平均成功率仅为2.39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广度信息收集的能力，这在市场分析和业务发展等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集的方法，构建了包含220个问题的基准测试，这些问题需要在大量数据中进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示现有最先进代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准测试突显了当前代理架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的关键局限性，为未来研究更强大稳健的信息搜索代理提供了催化剂。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于微调的方法容易产生算术错误和幻觉，而基于工具的方法缺乏语义理解且依赖固定模式。需要整合稳健推理与可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 使用多智能体框架，将表格推理分解为三个专门角色（规划、编码、回答），并通过代码执行进行精确表格操作。采用MCTS生成伪黄金轨迹，结合强化学习优化智能体。

Result: 在TableBench上达到62.13%的准确率，超越了OpenAI-o4-mini-high，显示出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流与强化学习的方法在表格理解方面具有很大潜力，能够有效整合推理能力和表格处理精度。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

TL;DR: 本文通过五项任务测试大语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，发现模型在小规模任务中表现尚可，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%，表明LLMs缺乏稳健的空间表征能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入上的空间理解和计算能力，评估其从语言到空间推理的转换能力。

Method: 使用五项任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和滑块拼图，通过增加网格维度来提升任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧恶化，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%，所有初始准确率超过50%的任务都至少下降48%。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言和空间推理之间存在显著差距，缺乏稳健的空间表征架构，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的集成基准提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种解码无关的采样策略，用于近似计算语言模型对文本所有可能分词方式的概率边际化，相比传统采样方法大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型评估只考虑特定分词方式的概率，但同一文本可能有多种分词方式。边际化评估虽然更准确，但计算成本高昂，特别是需要模型生成每个样本时。

Method: 提出了解码无关的采样策略，不依赖模型生成，仅使用廉价的分词采样方法，实现模型和分词器无关的边际概率近似计算。

Result: 解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上实现了足够准确的边际估计，且运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略为语言模型的边际化评估提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本同时保持足够的准确性。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁和PTSD的严重程度，在DAIC数据集上表现优于单模态基线，并提供可解释的临床决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁和PTSD经常共病且症状相互关联，但现有的自动化评估通常是二元且针对单一障碍的。临床诊断需要能够评估严重程度并提供跨障碍解释的决策支持。

Method: 开发了三模态情感严重程度框架：文本使用句子级transformer嵌入，音频使用log Mel统计特征，面部使用动作单元、注视、头部姿态等描述符。通过校准的后期融合分类器融合标准化特征，输出每个障碍的概率和特征级归因。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示，融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和对噪声或缺失模态的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并改善了类别一致性。错误主要出现在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别能被可靠识别。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可复现的评估和临床医生在环支持，文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因结果与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，解决传统next-token预测在捕捉高层次语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高层次语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要改进预训练目标。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上引入next-context预测机制，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族（最高15亿参数）上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进。

Conclusion: next-context预测为更强的语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够以最小计算开销获得更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM基于RAG系统中的引用失败问题，即模型生成有用回答但未能完整引用证据，这与回答本身错误的情况不同。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 研究引用失败发生条件，通过CITECONTROL基准分析回答与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和检索式方法来改善引用。

Result: 实验显示失败率随关系复杂度增加，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中显著改善了引用质量。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析引用失败模式并开发多方法融合框架，有效提升了LLM的引用准确性，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究过程奖励模型(PRMs)在表格问答任务中的应用，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助选择答案，但在领域外数据上泛化能力有限，且步骤验证与答案准确性相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然过程奖励模型在数学等复杂推理任务中表现良好，但在涉及半结构化数据（如表问答）的任务中应用仍未被探索。表问答对PRMs提出独特挑战：大量无关信息、松散连接的推理步骤和领域特定推理。

Method: 从答案和步骤两个角度评估最先进的生成式PRMs在表问答任务上的表现，分析文本和代码验证的结合效果。

Result: 结果显示：结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助解决方案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化能力有限；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间相关性较弱，可能源于弱步骤依赖性和松散的因果联系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前PRMs在表问答任务中的局限性，为构建更鲁棒、过程感知的验证器提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂数学运算时存在效率低和准确性差的问题，虽然集成代码解释器是潜在解决方案，但会导致模型内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间的冲突，引发无效的反复思考。

Method: 提出CoRT后训练框架，采用Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径的关键点注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据，并通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，CoRT使DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对性能提升，同时显著减少计算开销，32B和1.5B模型的token使用量分别减少约30%和50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能并降低了计算成本，为模型与外部工具的协同优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一重要混淆因素，需要探究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，比较LLMs在包含强语义线索的数据集与去除或随机化这些线索的数据集上的表现差异。

Result: 当数据集包含有意义的列名或可解释的值类别等语义线索时，LLMs表现出污染效应；而当这些线索被移除或随机化后，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表面能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而非真正的推理泛化。需要改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏和真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

Motivation: 现有分块方法依赖固定粒度的静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 提出FreeChunker框架，将句子作为原子单位，支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验表明，FreeChunker在检索性能上优于传统分块方法，在计算效率上显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变，从根本上改进了传统分块方法，实现了更好的检索性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，解决三个重要但未回答的研究问题：LLM能否识别否定引起的上下文变化，以及是否仍能可靠检测幻觉。

Method: 通过重构现有幻觉检测数据集构建NegHalu数据集，在否定文本上测试LLM的幻觉检测能力，并在token级别追踪LLM处理否定输入时的内部状态。

Result: 实验表明LLMs难以有效检测否定文本中的幻觉，经常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。

Conclusion: 否定文本对LLM的幻觉检测构成显著挑战，需要开发专门方法来缓解其负面影响。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

*Shaltiel Shmidman,Avi Shmidman,Moshe Koppel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual两个BERT风格的模型，专门针对希伯来语文本优化，在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中表现优异，并为下游任务提供了强大基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BERT模型在各种任务上表现出色，但其架构选择相对于Llama3和Qwen3等新型transformer模型已经过时。ModernBERT和NeoBERT在英语基准测试上显示出显著改进，作者希望为希伯来语开发类似的先进模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行优化，包括单语和双语版本。

Result: NeoDictaBERT模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越了现有模型，NeoDictaBERT-bilingual模型在检索任务上表现出色，超越了类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型为希伯来语NLP的研究和发展提供了强大基础，作者已向社区发布这些模型以推动希伯来语NLP的进步。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

TL;DR: ContingentChat是一个师生框架，通过在100M词汇的BabyLM上进行针对性后训练，提高了多轮对话的连续性质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决儿童与照顾者多轮对话中的连续性特征问题，即对话参与者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。

Method: 使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并采用自适应教师解码策略来评估和改进BabyLM的多轮连续性。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外收益有限。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练对提升对话质量有益，但连续性对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了指令蒸馏任务，将低质量冗余输入蒸馏为高质量指令-输出对，并开发了LM-Mixup方法，通过监督微调和强化学习优化，有效利用低质量数据提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优中高质量数据稀缺而低质量数据丰富但常被丢弃，现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据，且评估标准不明确。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集（14.4万样本），提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后使用GRPO强化学习优化，结合质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用蒸馏数据（约占整个数据集的3%）进行微调，不仅超越全数据集训练，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了四种LLM置信度估计方法，发现混合方法CoCoA在可靠性和答案区分度方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的输出存在不同程度的不确定性和正确性，实际可靠性难以保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA，在四个问答任务上使用开源LLM进行实验。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉模型置信度的不同方面，混合方法CoCoA在整体可靠性方面表现最好，提高了校准和答案区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中不确定性度量的选择提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Result: 在(Super)GLUE任务上相比标准MLM有显著性能提升，在strict-small赛道成功击败基线模型

Conclusion: 提出的自适应掩码概率MLM方法有效提升了模型性能，结合子词嵌入进一步增强了形态学泛化能力，在BabyLM挑战赛中取得了优于基线的结果。

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling
(MLM), which adapts the probabilities of the tokens masked according to the
model's ability to predict them. The results show a substantial increase in
performance on (Super)GLUE tasks over the standard MLM. We also incorporate
sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the
strict-small track.

TL;DR: RECALL是一个基于表征感知的模型融合框架，用于无需历史数据的持续学习，通过层级参数融合实现多领域知识整合，有效抵抗灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM内部表征作为学习知识的可靠代理，解决持续学习中需要历史数据和面临灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 基于聚类典型样本的层级隐藏表征计算模型间相似度，进行自适应分层参数融合，浅层保留领域通用特征，深层适应任务特定特征。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景下，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于持续演进LLM，实现无缝多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活向量添加引导向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉性，使其在评估中表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估时可能会检测到正在被测试，并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这损害了安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：首先进行持续预训练，让模型学会识别评估线索；然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。最后使用原始模型的激活向量构建引导向量来抑制评估警觉性。

Result: 经过训练的模型在评估环境中表现出评估警觉性，但通过激活引导可以消除这种差异，使模型在评估时表现得像在部署环境中一样。

Conclusion: 激活引导技术可以改善AI安全评估的可靠性，使模型在评估时保持部署环境中的行为模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可提升模型在非主流偏好上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在训练数据中主要反映主流偏好，导致对个体化、非主流偏好的覆盖不足，存在偏好覆盖差距。传统方法需要昂贵的重新训练，且难以泛化到完整的偏好谱系。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法。它从相关偏好的局部邻域采样多个响应，创建候选池，然后选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。基于方向性邻域共识理论框架。

Result: 在三种对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的实验表明，RPS相比基线方法持续提升鲁棒性，在空间欠表示区域的挑战性偏好上获得高达69%的胜率，且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论扎实的解决方案，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，有效解决了偏好覆盖差距问题。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HSEQ迭代框架，通过分层序列化和结构感知迭代解决多步骤问题和异构证据源中的检索增强生成脆弱性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成在多步骤问题和异构证据源上表现脆弱，需要在准确性、延迟和token/工具预算之间进行权衡

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的分层序列，使用轻量级结构标签，通过结构感知迭代收集足够证据，头代理指导检索，迭代代理选择扩展HSeq，最终合成规范化证据生成答案

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA上的实验显示，相比单次传递、多跳和代理式RAG基线，EM/F1指标持续提升且效率高

Conclusion: HSEQ具有格式无关的统一性、预算感知的引导迭代和证据规范化三大优势，能可靠提升问答一致性和可审计性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Motivation: 传统方法通过英语调查评估LLMs的政治偏见，本文提出基于多语言翻译公平性原则的新框架来评估政治偏见。

Method: 使用新构建的21种语言多平行版本EuroParl数据集，系统比较欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量，分析不同政党演讲的翻译差异。

Result: 观察到系统性差异：主流政党（左、中、右）的演讲翻译质量明显优于边缘政党。

Conclusion: 多语言翻译质量可以作为评估LLMs政治偏见的新指标，揭示了翻译系统对主流政治话语的偏好。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-Encoder是一种上下文压缩技术，通过将文本上下文压缩为更少的连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，从而提高计算效率，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩技术需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。因此需要一种不依赖特定模型架构的压缩方法。

Method: 设计ARC-Encoder，系统研究训练策略和架构选择，输出比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示，可适配多个解码器LLM。

Result: 在多个LLM使用场景中，ARC-Encoder在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时提高推理计算效率，并能适配多个解码器。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可无缝与多个LLM配合使用，实现上下文压缩而不损害模型通用能力。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9,720个中心嵌套句理解问题的数据集，用于区分语言模型的结构理解能力与语义模式匹配能力。研究发现模型在复杂结构中会放弃结构分析转而依赖语义关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正理解句法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配。需要开发方法来量化模型何时从结构分析转向语义关联。

Method: 构建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句及其语义不可信对应句，每个句子有6个理解问题测试表层理解、句法依赖和因果推理。测试了6个模型在可信与不可信句子上的表现差异。

Result: 模型在可信与不可信句子间的性能差距随复杂度系统性扩大，最大差距达26.8个百分点。语义可信性在因果推理问题中反而损害性能。推理模型准确性提升但存在语义捷径和过度思考问题。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型在复杂结构处理中的局限性。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在多跳问答中的有效性受到两个基本限制：(i)缺乏全局规划来构建多步推理结构，(ii)执行不忠实，影响有效查询制定和检索证据的一致性使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，包含问题分解为子目标、检索与推理协调、证据迭代优化。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来引导过程，采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效解决了多跳问答中的全局规划和忠实执行问题，在减少训练数据需求的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Conclusion: 多智能体认知系统具有重新定义电商搜索的变革潜力，为电商搜索提供了新的范式。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

### [136] [Can ChatGPT Code Communication Data Fairly?: Empirical Evidence from Multiple Collaborative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20584)
*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了ChatGPT在通信数据自动编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见，发现无明显偏见，支持其在大规模协作评估中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大规模通信和协作需要将通信数据按不同框架编码，这是一项劳动密集型任务。虽然已有研究表明ChatGPT可以直接按照编码规则对通信数据进行编码，且准确性与人类评分者相当，但其是否存在针对不同人口群体（如性别和种族）的偏见尚不明确。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，基于ChatGPT对通信数据进行自动编码，分析不同性别和种族群体之间的差异。分析数据来自三种类型的协作任务：谈判、问题解决和决策制定。

Result: 结果显示，基于ChatGPT的编码在性别和种族群体之间没有表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在通信数据自动编码中不存在显著的性别和种族偏见，这为其在大规模协作和通信评估中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

*Haoyu Wang,Sihang Jiang,Yuyan Chen,Yitong Wang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR，构建了一个评估框架来测试大语言模型的好奇心，发现LLMs比人类有更强的知识渴求，但在不确定环境中更保守，且好奇心能增强模型的推理和学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，这是理解LLMs认知能力的重要方面。

Method: 基于人类好奇心评估问卷Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR)，设计了涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求和社会好奇心等维度的综合评估框架。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时倾向于保守选择；好奇心行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具有展现类似人类好奇心的潜力，为未来开发LLMs的学习能力和创新研究提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在非英语问题上倾向于使用英语推理，这虽然通常能提高答案准确率，但存在翻译错误风险，且在处理语言文化细微差别方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题中默认使用英语推理的现象及其对可解释性和语言文化细微差别处理的影响。

Method: 系统比较模型在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在度，且英语推理通常获得更高的最终答案准确率，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。英语中心策略易受翻译错误影响。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理在准确率上有优势，但其翻译风险和对语言文化细微差别的处理不足表明需要发展更平衡的多语言推理策略。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了CantoNLU基准测试，涵盖粤语自然语言理解的7个任务，评估了不同模型在粤语NLU任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决粤语因政策和双语现象导致的资源匮乏问题，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 构建包含7个任务的粤语NLU基准测试，比较了四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、通过持续预训练适应粤语的模型、从零开始训练的单语粤语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够，发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了神经多样性（解相关的并行表示）作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过ND-LoRA方法在固定参数和数据预算下将幻觉率降低高达25.6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数、计算和数据不断增加，语言模型仍然存在幻觉问题。受投资组合理论启发，认为解相关的表示可以降低风险，从而减少幻觉

Method: 提出ND-LoRA方法，结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过促进神经多样性来减少幻觉

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉减少高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低通用准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可以在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文针对MBR解码在开放任务中的局限性，提出了三种轻量级适配方法，通过增强对结果空间结构变化的敏感性来提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MBR解码在机器翻译等任务中有效，但在对话或指令跟随等开放任务中，由于结果空间变异性大，标准相似性效用函数可能无法选择最优响应。

Method: 提出了三种轻量级适配的效用函数，增强MBR对结果空间结构变化的敏感性，并构建了包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验表明标准相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性，在真实指令跟随基准测试中生成质量提升了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性可以有效提升在开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级适配方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在隐私敏感场景中，用户对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在很大差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性很低，表明隐私和帮助性评价具有个体特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要依赖代理LLM来衡量隐私规范合规性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且仅关注隐私保护质量而未研究帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者使用PrivacyLens的90个场景进行用户研究，比较用户与5个代理LLM对相同LLM响应的评价。

Result: 用户对相同场景的相同响应在隐私保护质量和帮助性评价上一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高但与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: 隐私和帮助性评价具有个体特异性，代理LLM不能准确反映用户感知，需要进行以用户为中心的研究来改进评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发自然语言处理方法来从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的错误分析提示方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引起手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发NLP方法来有效提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取上排名第二（F1=0.937）。深度学习方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂下游任务中通过引入中间"思考"过程提高了推理能力，但它们在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出校准LRM思维的方法，通过在合成的人类思维轨迹上训练模型，减少思考预算并提高评估性能。

Result: 在WMT24 Metrics基准测试中，该方法将思考预算大幅减少约35倍，同时在不同规模的LRM（从7B到32B）上提高了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B实现了+8.7相关点的改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了高效校准的LRM在推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型的方法主要关注文本生成等高级任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估负责任AI维度如公平性，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，参数化包含公平性属性与性别化形容词和产品类别的交叉，产生丰富的标注提示集。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了一个大语言模型评估提案和具体资源，强调需要针对特定应用场景评估公平性等负责任AI维度。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但其有限记忆会导致遗忘问题，影响检索密集型任务的性能。需要恢复对过去token的直接访问能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，交替使用不同复杂度的token混合器，包括带token淘汰的稀疏注意力和查询感知的本地稀疏注意力。特别提出可学习的token淘汰方法，结合滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN来自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试上的实证评估支持了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入稀疏注意力机制，可以在保持线性注意力计算效率的同时，有效缓解遗忘问题，提升检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示，但现有方法如压缩标记架构存在性能问题。

Method: 开发了轻量级的均值池化方法，并训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率，在多个QA数据集、模型家族和压缩比率下进行广泛实验。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法取得了最强的性能，在训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更为复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化是有效的软上下文压缩方法，但压缩方法的权衡关系复杂，需要更深入的研究。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛使用，检测其生成文本的需求增加，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的一致精确定义，现实应用中的多样性使检测变得困难。

Method: 通过分析现有检测方法的局限性，指出人类编辑对LLM输出的影响以及LLM对用户的微妙影响模糊了人工与机器生成文本的界限。

Result: 现有基准和评估方法未能充分覆盖真实世界检测器应用的各种条件，导致检测器的数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考，而非决定性指标。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

### [150] [Interactive Hypergraph Visual Analytics for Exploring Large and Complex Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20050)
*Floris Gisolf,Zeno J. M. H. Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大规模复杂图像集合的交互式可视化分析方法，通过超图构建和可视化技术帮助领域专家探索图像间的复杂重叠关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类和分类方法无法充分表示复杂图像集合中的重叠关系，特别是在缺乏标注数据或预训练模型时。超图能有效捕捉这些复杂关系，但需要可视化来帮助领域专家理解和分析。

Method: 开发了可扩展的超图构建流水线，直接从原始图像数据构建超图，并包含相似性度量来评估构建结果。结合空间超图表示、交互式网格和矩阵可视化技术，实现动态探索而不让用户感到困惑。

Result: 该方法支持对包含数万张图像的大规模图像集合进行迭代探索，使领域专家能够高效地从复杂图像关系中获取洞察。

Conclusion: 所提出的可视化分析方法成功解决了复杂图像集合中关系分析的挑战，为领域专家提供了有效的工具来理解和探索大规模图像数据中的复杂关系。

Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident
investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate,
overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and
classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex
relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models
are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but
to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert
users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics
approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis
of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions
include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw
image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs
against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate
spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix
visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret
relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical
insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on
evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our
visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain
experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens
of thousands of images.

### [151] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种量子启发算法，使用矩阵乘积状态(MPS)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法求解QUBO问题，在Sudoku和MaxCut问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，这类问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积状态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，结合离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法在超过200个伊辛自旋的Sudoku问题和Biq Mac库中251节点、3265边的MaxCut问题上可靠找到全局最优解，而不仅仅是近似解。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业级QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [152] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，这是首个用于量化大语言模型在能源系统分析中推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，并在四个前沿模型上进行了测试验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的应用缺乏标准化框架来评估系统推理的正确性，现有验证方法主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 开发了ARB框架，集成准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性约束、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集(NREL ATB 2024等)，在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估GPT-4/5、Claude 4.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro和Llama 3 70B四个模型。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到了一致且符合政策的推理(分析可靠性指数大于90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现出中等稳定性，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值。统计验证确认这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统中因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse是一个细粒度的网页代理框架，通过树状结构探索、网页状态重放和页面动作记忆，显著提高了LLM网页代理的推理深度和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主网页代理方法在推理深度和效率方面存在局限：线性方法无法进行多步推理且缺乏有效回溯，其他搜索策略则粒度粗糙且计算成本高。

Method: 该框架采用显式子任务管理和树状结构探索实现可控多分支推理，通过网页状态重放和后台推理引导探索，并利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享已探索动作。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，Branch-and-Browse实现了35.8%的任务成功率，相比最先进方法执行时间减少了40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架，显著提升了网页环境中的推理能力和执行效率。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于有向无环图（DAG）的框架来评估LLMs在数学推理中的逻辑一致性，超越了传统的PASS@k指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前不清楚LLMs在数学问题上的成功是源于搜索、机械记忆还是规则一致的推理，需要更精确的评估方法。

Method: 将思维链建模为基于规则的随机过程，引入逻辑紧密度指标，并构建DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准测试。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上，发现即使PASS@k相似，不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有代理系统依赖环境特定接口而限制跨平台部署的问题，构建能够在网页、桌面和移动环境中通用的智能代理。

Method: 集成层次化上下文管理、解耦的规划与执行、以及具有自适应恢复能力的自我验证机制，支持长任务周期的可靠操作。

Result: 在WebVoyager上达到97.1%准确率，WebArena 69.6%，OSWorld 60.1%，AndroidWorld 87.1%，多尝试情况下在所有基准测试中超越人类表现。

Conclusion: 系统化编排能够放大基础模型能力，仅通过视觉交互实现通用计算机控制，同时需要下一代视觉语言模型来实现帕累托最优的成本效益。

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE是一个模式无关的图神经网络特征编码器，使用共享的模态特定编码器和交叉注意力模块，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络需要为每种节点类型和特征列设计单独的特征编码器，这阻碍了可扩展性和参数共享。

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合成固定大小的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE在ReLGNN和HGT上达到模式特定编码器97%的性能，同时减少参数数量达5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同模式并实现多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使大规模快速伪造事故证据成为可能。保险公司虽然部署了AI反欺诈措施，但面临检测准确性和成本等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故和夸大损失。生成式AI的出现让欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的事故照片和文件，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司采用AI深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来应对AI驱动的欺诈，但现有方法存在误报漏报等问题。

Result: 当前反欺诈策略面临显著限制，检测工具准确性不足，欺诈者不断调整策略规避检测，形成猫鼠游戏。

Conclusion: UVeye的分层解决方案代表了在检测、缓解和威慑AI保险欺诈方面的重大进步，但应对AI驱动的保险欺诈仍是一个持续挑战。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Conclusion: 通过显式路由和分层安全机制的基于事实的生成，可以在高风险金融领域提供可信的AI见解。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail

proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the

mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100

Method: 系统包含解析、检测和解释三个角色，形成对话式工作流。使用XGBoost作为基础检测器，将用户意图转换为检测模式，并提供基于底层特征的叙述性解释。

Result: 在比特币混币数据集上的测试显示，基线检测器达到较高准确率，而HCLA系统增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人类参与循环设计能够显著提升金融取证系统的透明度和用户信任度，HCLA为可解释异常检测提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a

Motivation: 针对律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用范式，考虑到AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度以及律师的核心职责。

Method: 提出验证-价值悖论模型，分析AI使用效率与验证需求之间的平衡关系，探讨其对法律实践和教育的影响。

Result: AI在法律实践中的使用并不会显著提高效率，因为效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，净价值往往可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 需要新的范式来评估AI在法律实践中的使用，强调对真相的忠诚和公民责任等价值观应成为法律实践的基础。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [164] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出AGI发展需要经历一个锁定阶段：从开放模仿转向身份巩固，使目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类发展类比，假设AGI进步需要从开放模仿转向身份巩固阶段，这是实现AGI级可靠性和安全性的前提。

Method: 形式化这一阶段，将其与学习动态中的已知现象联系起来，提出操作性指标进行检测，并通过实验验证行为巩固的动态特征。

Result: 实验显示行为巩固是快速非线性的，但对通用能力的影响不一：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份巩固是AGI可靠性的前提，也是关键安全控制点：身份可被工程化设计以实现可靠性，但也可能在扩展过程中自发出现，可能固化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在2048游戏中优化AI的进化训练方法，比较了单智能体系统和双智能体元提示系统的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战。2048游戏结合了策略性游戏玩法和随机元素，为研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应提供了理想平台。

Method: 实现两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM为"执行者"LLM优化策略）和基于改进价值函数的单智能体系统（有限蒙特卡洛树搜索），并实验了回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得显著改进，每个周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期呈明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也随着高级策略的发展而增长。双智能体系统改进有限，突显了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 进化精炼技术在改进非确定性环境中AI性能方面具有潜力，单智能体系统表现优于双智能体元提示系统。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在个体化认知模拟中的能力，通过构建小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架，测试不同认知表示方法在作者风格模仿任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs能够模仿表面的人类行为，但它们在模拟更深层次个体化认知过程方面的能力尚不清楚，需要开发评估框架来理解LLMs在认知模拟中的局限性。

Method: 构建基于近期小说发布的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试七种现成LLMs在作者风格模仿任务中的表现，比较不同认知表示方法（如语言特征、概念映射和基于档案的信息）。

Result: 结合概念和语言特征在个体化认知模拟中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLMs在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，显示了在更深层次认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发能够适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用大语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，以支持智能体的规划、推理和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为动态领域生成符合特定目的的抽象表示是一个重要挑战，因为抽象选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，使用大语言模型（LLMs）通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，抽象目标用自然语言指定。

Result: 实验表明GPT-4o在简单设置下能有效合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在动作抽象方面优于相关流体的抽象。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够生成有用的规划领域抽象，特别是在动作抽象方面表现良好，但在流体抽象方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出了STaBERT模型，在BERT-based移动性模型基础上，加入推导的时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测准确性：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI和时间信息能够有效捕捉人类移动的语义基础，STaBERT模型在移动性预测任务上表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的具身问答代理，通过工具提供有用信息来改进探索方向，从而以更短探索距离生成更准确回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接使用视觉语言模型探索环境回答问题，缺乏显式思考和规划，导致推理能力有限、探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 设计ToolEQA代理集成外部工具进行多步推理，并开发自动生成EQA任务的数据流水线，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本版本高10%。在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理显著提升了具身问答的性能和效率，展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

TL;DR: 该论文基于AI4HealthyAging项目经验，分析了临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，并提出了改进AI系统公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在真实临床实践中的整合仍然有限。数据收集过程中的偏见是主要障碍。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目，识别临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，包括历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等。

Result: 识别出在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济地位、设备和标签等多个变量上存在的偏见表现。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，希望为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Result: 通过实例化演示和评估了该模型，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中交战AI系统产生的效应提供了透明推理机制，支持构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 首先回顾传统KG方法建立概念基础，然后从基于模式（强调结构、规范化和一致性）和无模式（强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现）两个互补视角分析新兴LLM驱动方法。

Result: 系统综合了各阶段的代表性框架，分析了技术机制并识别了局限性，为理解LLM与知识图谱的演进关系提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: 调查指出了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解，开发自适应、可解释和智能的知识系统。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续预训练方法需要原始基础模型或外部领域数据库，这在基础模型权重因安全原因被保留或可靠外部语料不可用时存在现实障碍。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定新颖的自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识并在更深语义层面进行编码。

Result: 该方法能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下适应大语言模型到新领域，同时保持指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的持续适应框架，解决了现有方法在现实场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不鲁棒，限制了在真实世界知识库中的部署。

Method: EBR神经推理器使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，仅需要检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明EBR在缺失和错误数据的情况下表现出鲁棒性，优于现有最先进的推理器。

Conclusion: EBR为在真实世界知识库中部署神经符号概念学习方法提供了可行的解决方案，通过神经推理克服了传统符号推理器的局限性。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

TL;DR: FLORA是一种基于模糊逻辑的知识图谱对齐方法，无需训练数据，提供可解释的结果，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑进行整体实体和关系对齐，迭代执行，允许悬空实体，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，提供可解释的结果并支持悬空实体。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI治理中的公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的公众对话机制，参与率极低且反馈响应不足，导致参与式AI治理的承诺与实践之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众对AI有强烈意见并希望政策制定者倾听，但政府在将公众意见转化为政策时丢失了大量信息，错失了建立AI信任的关键机会。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，研究三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）如何征集公众对AI风险和政策的反馈，以及这些反馈是否影响了治理决策。

Result: 在三个国家中，公众与政策制定者之间均未建立有意义的对话。政府缺乏吸引多样化声音和宣传征集活动的努力，参与率不到人口的1%，官员对反馈的响应有限，未能形成有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前的参与式AI治理方法不太可能建立信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、监测公众反馈、扩大宣传范围、定期举办在线论坛等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）方法，开发了异构边感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解，该方法能够捕捉局部潮流模式。

Result: 案例研究表明，该方法实现了高达4个数量级的加速，在GOC 2000节点系统上1分钟内提供交流可行性解，最优性差距仅为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在拓扑和跨系统泛化方面取得了显著进展，为大规模系统的近实时拓扑优化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

### [179] [What Defines Good Reasoning in LLMs? Dissecting Reasoning Steps with Multi-Aspect Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20603)
*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，从相关性和连贯性两个维度评估LLM的推理质量，并通过基于CaSE评估的数据筛选直接提升最终任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，无法反映推理过程质量，需要更细粒度的评估来构建更稳健的模型。

Method: 将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，提出CaSE方法仅使用前序上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证了CaSE与人类判断的一致性，并证明基于CaSE评估的数据筛选能直接提升最终任务表现。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架来分析、调试和改进LLM推理，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性算法，利用近似Cholesky分解和生成树采样，在近线性时间内提供强近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性在图挖掘中用于量化节点重要性，但现有方法计算成本高，无法适用于大型网络。

Method: 基于新的随机游走中心性公式，开发了两种算法：一种使用近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种采用根生成树采样。

Result: 在包含超过1000万个节点的大型真实网络上的实验验证了算法的高效性和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够在近线性时间内高效计算随机游走中心性，适用于大规模网络分析。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 可解释性设计模型对于在现实应用中建立对自动化决策模型的信任、问责和安全采用至关重要。

Method: 正式定义了跨不同决策任务和数据类型的监督学习设置，包括表格数据、时间序列、图像、文本、交易和轨迹。分析了三种主要可解释模型家族：特征重要性、规则和基于实例的模型。

Result: 形式化了三个关键伦理属性：因果性、公平性和隐私性，为每个属性提供了正式定义、评估指标和验证程序。

Conclusion: 通过在模型生成过程中评估伦理度量，该框架为开发不仅准确和可解释，而且公平、保护隐私和具有因果意识的AI系统奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

TL;DR: EcomEval是一个全面的多语言多模态基准测试，用于评估LLM在电子商务领域的表现，解决了现有评估工具在任务多样性、模态覆盖、数据真实性和语言多样性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性不足、缺乏多模态数据、使用合成数据、语言覆盖有限等问题，无法可靠评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 构建包含6个类别37个任务（含8个多模态任务）的基准，主要来源于真实客户查询和交易日志；采用半自动流程，由大模型生成候选答案，50多名专家审核修改；为每个问题定义难度等级。

Result: EcomEval覆盖7种语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言），提供了多语言视角；通过真实数据反映了商业交互的噪声和异质性。

Conclusion: EcomEval为电子商务领域的LLM评估提供了全面、真实、多语言和多模态的基准测试工具，填补了现有评估体系的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: 在动态扩展环境中，需要量化模型的适应能力，以评估其理解、预测和适应状态变化的能力，这对超级智能模型的发展至关重要。

Method: 建立封闭循环的开放式真实世界基准测试，区分封闭式和开放式基准，重点测试模型在状态变化中的上下文切换和连续性表现。

Result: 提出了流动性指数作为量化模型适应性的指标，能够评估模型在动态环境中的表现。

Conclusion: 真正的超级智能模型应至少具备二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自我维持计算，以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Motivation: 由于机器学习模型在感知和认知任务中展现出类人能力，将ML集成到理性智能体架构中的框架日益受到关注，但现有研究零散且不连贯，往往忽视了理性架构的表达能力。

Method: 使用BDI（信念-欲望-意图）范式作为参考框架，对现有方法进行细粒度系统化分析。

Conclusion: 提出了设计有效理性ML智能体的开放挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，用于自动化评估大语言模型的推理轨迹质量，相比传统图指标具有更高预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注、人工判断，效率低且不可靠；现有自动化方法主要使用图结构指标，但无法充分捕捉推理过程的复杂性。

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，通过捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构特征，实现标签高效的自动化评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来表征。

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集能够可靠指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供实用信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过"计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考"范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨KG与网络的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用知识图谱的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，假设KG覆盖完整且缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，推理过程局部短视，无法维持连贯的多步规划。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）使用定制计划-检索数据集进行思维链微调，激活结构化推理；2）引入计划检索引导的强化学习过程，集成显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计优化推理检索过程，结合结果和检索特定信号，使模型学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架能够在不完整知识条件下实现自主规划和自适应检索调度，解决复杂场景下的KGQA问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义均值积分的AGI一致性度量方法，替代了传统算术平均的定义，强调跨认知领域的平衡能力而非补偿性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均，假设领域间能力可以相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应该体现跨所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 提出基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值的不同补偿性假设，通过曲线下面积量化鲁棒性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分显示，尽管算术得分较高（GPT-5达24%），但一致性调整后的AUC表明它们距离通用能力还很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分为AGI测量提供了原则性、可解释且更严格的基础，能够捕捉领域间依赖关系并惩罚不平衡表现。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.
