While recent\nbenchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often\nfall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel\nplans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies\nfine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan\nquality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our\nevaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\\%)\nand outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a\nlarge-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form\nrequests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we\nconduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including\ntest-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and\nRL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility\nover prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward\nscores."}

Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for\nMed-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a\nframework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a\nunified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,\nmodalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and\noptimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft\nlabels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair\ndiscrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that\nintegrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant\ninformation from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on\nwidely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019."}
